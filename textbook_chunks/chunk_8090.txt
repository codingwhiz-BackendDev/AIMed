Since diabetes can be life-threatening if not properly
managed, patients should not attempt to treat this condi-
tion without medicial supervision. A variety of alterna-
tive therapies can be helpful in managing the symptoms
of diabetes and supporting patients with the disease.
Acupuncture can help relieve the pain associated with
diabetic neuropathy by stimulation of cetain points. A
qualified practitioner should be consulted. Herbal reme-
dies may also be helpful in managing diabetes. Although
there is no herbal substitute for insulin, some herbs may
help adjust blood sugar levels or manage other diabetic
symptoms. Some options include:
• fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) has been
shown in some studies to reduce blood insulin and glu-
cose levels while also lowering cholesterol
• bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) may lower blood glu-
cose levels, as well as helping to maintain healthy
blood vessels
• garlic (Allium sativum) may lower blood sugar and cho-
lesterol levels
• onions (Allium cepa) may help lower blood glucose
levels by freeing insulin to metabolize it
• cayenne pepper (Capsicum frutescens) can help relieve
pain in the peripheral nerves (a type of diabetic neu-
ropathy)
• ginkgo (Gingko biloba) may maintain blood flow to the
retina, helping to prevent diabetic retinopathy
Any therapy that lowers stress levels can also be use-
ful in treating diabetes by helping to reduce insulin
requirements. Among the alternative treatments that aim
to lower stress are hypnotherapy, biofeedback, and
meditation.

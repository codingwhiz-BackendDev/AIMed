Electrolyte tests are performed from routine blood
tests. The techniques are simple, automated, and fairly
uniform throughout the United States. During the prepa-
ration of blood plasma or serum, health workers must
take care not to break the red blood cells, especially
when testing for serum potassium. Because the concen-
tration of potassium within red blood cells is much high-
er than in the surrounding plasma or serum, broken cells
would cause falsely elevated potassium levels.

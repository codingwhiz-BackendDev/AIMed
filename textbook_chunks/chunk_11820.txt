A diseased external sphincter muscle will produce
an abnormal pattern of electrical activity. Conditions that
affect the external sphincter may include multiple scle-
rosis, neurogenic bladder, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, spinal
cord injury, and stress incontinence. However, addi-
tional tests must be done in order to confirm any of these
diagnoses.

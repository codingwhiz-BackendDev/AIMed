There is no treatment available to shorten the course
of dengue fever, DHF, or DSS. Medications can be given
to lower the fever and to decrease the pain of muscle
aches and headaches. Fluids are given through a needle
in a vein to prevent dehydration. Blood transfusions
may be necessary if severe hemorrhaging occurs. Oxy-
gen should be administered to patients in shock.

Untreated or improperly treated depression is the
number one cause of suicide in the United States. Proper
treatment relieves symptoms in 80–90% of depressed
patients. After each major depressive episode, the risk of
recurrence climbs significantly—50% after one episode,
70% after two episodes, and 90% after three episodes.
For this reason, patients need to be aware of the symp-
toms of recurring depression and may require long-term
maintenance treatment of antidepressants and/or therapy.

Rh
incompatibility disease and ABO incompatibility disease.
Both diseases have similar symptoms, but Rh disease is
much more severe, because anti-Rh antibodies cross over
the placenta more readily than anti-A or anti-B antibod-
ies. (The immune system does not form antibodies
against the O antigen.) Therefore, a greater percentage of
the baby’s blood cells are destroyed by Rh disease.
Both incompatibility diseases are uncommon in the
United States due to medical advances over the last 50
years. For example, prior to 1946 (when newborn blood
transfusions were introduced) 20,000 babies were affected
by Rh disease yearly. Further advances, such as suppress-
ing the mother’s antibody response, have reduced the inci-
dence of Rh disease to approximately 4,000 cases per year.
Rh disease only occurs if a mother is Rh-negative and
her baby is Rh-positive. For this situation to occur, the baby
must inherit the Rh factor gene from the father. Most peo-
ple are Rh-positive. Only 15% of the caucasian population
is Rh-negative, compared to 5–7% of the african american
population and virtually none of Asian populations.
ABO incompatibility disease is almost always limit-
ed to babies with A or B antigens whose mothers have
type O blood. Approximately one third of these babies
show evidence of the mother’s antibodies in their blood-
stream, but only a small percentage develop symptoms of
ABO incompatibility disease.

After sedation, a specially adapted endoscope is
passed through the mouth, through the stomach, then into
the duodenum. The opening to ducts that empty from the
liver and pancreas is identified, and a plastic tube or
catheter is placed into the orifice (opening). Contrast dye
is then injected into the ducts, and with the assistance of
a radiologist, pictures are taken.

ed radical right or left colectomy). If the primary tumor
penetrates through the bowel wall, any tissue adjacent to
the tumor extension is also taken if feasible.
Surgery is used as primary therapy for stages I
through III colon cancer unless there are signs that local
invasion will not permit complete removal of the tumor,
as may occur in advanced stage III tumors. However, this
circumstance is very rare, and occurs in less than 2% of
all colon cancer cases.
After the resection is completed, the ends of the
remaining colon are reconstructed; the hook-up is called
an anastomosis. Once healing has occurred, there may be a
slight increase in the frequency of bowel movements. This
effect usually lasts only for several weeks. Most patients
go on to develop completely normal bowel function.
Occasionally, the anastomosis would be risky and
cannot be performed. (Most commonly, this occurs when
the bowel could not be adequately evacuated in an emer-
gency circumstance due to bowel obstruction.) When the
anastomosis cannot be performed, a colostomy is per-
formed instead. A colostomy is performed by bringing the
end of the colon through the abdominal wall and sewing it
to the skin. The patient will have to wear an appliance (a
bag) to manage the stool. The colostomy may be tempo-
rary and the patient may undergo a hook-up at a later, safer
date, or the colostomy may be permanent. In most cases,
emergent colostomies are not reversed and are permanent.

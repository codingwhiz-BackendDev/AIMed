Applying gentle pressure to the webbed area
between the thumb and index finger of either hand can
calm a crying child. So can gently massaging the area
directly above the child’s navel and the corresponding
spot on the spine. Applying warm compresses or holding
your hand firmly over the child’s abdomen can relieve
cramping.
Teas made with chamomile (Matricaria recutita),
lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), peppermint (Mentha
piperita), or dill (Anethum graveolens) can lessen bowel
inflammation and reduce gas. A homeopathic combina-
tion called “colic” may be effective, and constitutional
homeopathic treatment can help strenthen the child’s
entire constitution.

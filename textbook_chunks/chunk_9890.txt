The patient disrobes from the waist up, and elec-
trodes (tiny wires in adhesive pads) are applied to specif-
ic sites on the arms, legs, and chest. When attached, the
electrodes are called leads; three to 12 leads may be
employed.
Muscle movement may interfere with the recording,
which lasts for several beats of the heart. In cases where
rhythm disturbances are suspected to be infrequent, the
patient may wear a small Holter monitor in order to
record continuously over a 24-hour period; this is known
as ambulatory monitoring.

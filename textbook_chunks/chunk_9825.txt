Definition
Electrical nerve stimulation, also called transcuta-
neous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), is a noninva-
sive, drug-free pain management technique. By sending
electrical signals to underlying nerves, the battery-pow-
ered TENS device can relieve a wide range of chronic
and acute pain.

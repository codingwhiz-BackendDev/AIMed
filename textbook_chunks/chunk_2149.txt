Chemotherapy, the use of one or more drugs to kill
cancer cells, is used to treat disease that has spread
beyond the cervix. Most often it is used following
surgery or radiation treatment. Stages IIB, III, IV, and
recurrent cervical cancers usually are treated with a
combination of external and internal radiation and
chemotherapy. The common drugs used for cervical
cancer are cisplatin, ifosfamide, and fluorouracil. These
may be injected or taken by mouth. The National Cancer
Institute recommends that chemotherapy with cisplatin
be considered for all women receiving radiation therapy
for cervical cancer.
The side effects of chemotherapy depend on a num-
ber of factors, including the type of drug, the dosage, and
the length of the treatment. Side effects may include:
• nausea and vomiting
• fatigue
• changes in appetite
• hair loss
• mouth or vaginal sores
• infections
• menstrual cycle changes
• premature menopause
• infertility
• bleeding or anemia (low red blood cell count)
With the exception of menopause and infertility,
most of the side effects are temporary.

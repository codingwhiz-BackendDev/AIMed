Diagnosis of congestive cardiomyopathy is based on:
• symptoms
• medical history
• physical examination
• chest x ray
• electrocardiogram (ECG; also called EKG)
• echocardiogram
• cardiac catheterization
The diagnosis is based on the patient’s symptoms, a
complete physical examination, and tests that detect
abnormalities of the heart chambers. The physician lis-
tens to the heart with a stethoscope to detect abnormal
heart rhythms and heart sounds. A heart murmur might
mean that the heart valves are not closing properly due to
the ventricles being enlarged.
A chest x ray can show if the heart is enlarged and if
there is fluid in the lungs. Abnormalities of heart valves
and other structures may also be seen on a chest x ray.
An electrocardiogram provides a record of electrical
changes in the heart muscle during the heartbeat. It gives
information on the heart rhythm and can show if the
heart chamber is enlarged. An ECG can detect damage to
the heart muscle and the amount of damage.

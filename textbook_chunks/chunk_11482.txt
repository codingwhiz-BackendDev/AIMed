Infants with esophageal atresia are unlikely to survive
without surgery to reconnect the esophagus. The procedure
is done as soon as possible; however, prematurity, the
presence of other birth defects, or complications of apira-
tion pneumonia may delay surgery. Once diagnosed, the
baby will be fed intraveneously until he or she has recov-
ered sufficiently from the operation. Mucus and saliva will
also be continuously removed via a catheter until recovery
has occured. When surgery is performed, the esophagus is
reconnected and, if neccessary, separated from the trachea.
If the two ends of the esophagus are too far apart to be reat-
tached, tissue from the large intestine is used to join them.

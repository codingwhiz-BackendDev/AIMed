After the operation, the patient will awaken lying
flat and face down, and must remain this way for several
days, changing position only to avoid bedsores. There
maybe slight pain or stiffness in the back area.
Patients should sleep on a firm mattress and avoid
bending at the waist, lifting heavy weights, or sitting in
one spot for a long time (such as riding in a car).
After surgery, patients can usually leave the hospital
on the fourth or fifth day. They must:
• avoid sitting for more than 15–20 minutes
• use a reclined chair
• avoid bending, twisting, or lifting
• begin gentle walking (indoors or outdoors), gradually
increasing
• begin stationary biking or gentle swimming after two
weeks
• continue exercise for the next four weeks
• slow down if they experience more than minor pain in
the back or leg

of diverticulitis is not difficult in
patients with previously diagnosed diverticulosis. The
presence of abdominal pain and fever in such an indi-
vidual would make the suspicion of diverticulitis quite
high. Examination of the abdomen will usually reveal
tenderness to touch, with the patient’s abdominal mus-
cles contracting strongly to protect the tender area.
During a rectal exam (performed by inserting a finger
into the rectum), a doctor may be able to feel an
abnormal mass. Touching this mass may prove painful
to the patient.
When a practitioner is suspicious of diverticulitis as
the cause for the patient’s symptoms, he or she will most
likely avoid the types of tests usually used to diagnose
gastrointestinal disorders. These include barium enema
and endoscopy. The concern is that the increased pres-
sure exerted on the intestine during these exams may
increase the likelihood of intestinal perforation. After
medical treatment for the diverticulitis, these examina-
tions may be performed in order to learn the extent of the
patient’s disease.

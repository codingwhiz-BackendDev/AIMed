Cleft lips and palates not associated with a syn-
drome are caused by a combination of genetic and envi-
ronmental factors. Inheritance caused by such a combi-
nation is called multifactorial. The embryo inherits genes
that increase the risk for cleft lip and/or palate. When an
embryo with such genes is exposed to certain environ-
mental factors the embryo develops a cleft.
The risk of a baby being born with a cleft lip or
palate increases with the number of affected relatives and
increases with relatives that have more severe clefts.
Environmental factors that increase the risk of cleft
lip and palate include cigarette and alcohol use during

The amount of relief a person gets using TENS
depends on the underlying cause of the pain, a person’s
mental state, and whether or not medication is also used.
At least one study found that both a real TENS machine
and a placebo were equally effective in reducing pain.
This suggests that at least part of its effectiveness may be
due to the patient’s belief in its ability to ease pain.

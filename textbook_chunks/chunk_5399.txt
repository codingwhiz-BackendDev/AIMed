Constipation is one of the most common medical
complaints in the United States. Constipation can occur
at any age, and is more common among individuals who
resist the urge to move their bowels at their body’s sig-
nal. This often happens when children start school or
enter daycare and feel shy about asking permission to use
the bathroom.
Constipation is more common in women than in
men and is especially apt to occur during pregnancy.
Age alone does not increase the frequency of constipa-
tion, but elderly people (especially women) are more
likely to suffer from constipation.
Although this condition is rarely serious, it can lead to:
• bowel obstruction
• chronic constipation
• hemorrhoids (a mass of dilated veins in swollen tissue
around the anus)
• hernia (a protrusion of an organ through a tear in the
muscle wall)
• spastic colitis (irritable bowel syndrome, a condition
characterized by alternating periods of diarrhea and
constipation)
• laxative dependency

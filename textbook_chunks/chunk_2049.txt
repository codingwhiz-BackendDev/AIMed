Patients can go about their normal activities before a
lumbar puncture. Experts recommend that patients relax

the lumbar puncture needle must pass through muscle
tissue before it reaches the spinal canal. A patient’s level
of relaxation before and during the procedure plays a
critical role in the test’s success.

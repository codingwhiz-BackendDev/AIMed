Portal or nutritional cirrhosis is the form of the dis-
ease most common in the United States. About 30–50%
of all cases of cirrhosis are this type. Nine out of every 10
people who have nutritional cirrhosis have a history of
alcoholism. Portal or nutritional cirrhosis is also called
Laënnec’s cirrhosis.
Biliary cirrhosis is caused by intrahepatic bile-duct
diseases that impede bile flow. Bile is formed in the liver
and is carried by ducts to the intestines. Bile then helps
digest fats in the intestines. Biliary cirrhosis can scar or
block these ducts. It represents 15–20% of all cirrhosis.
Various types of chronic hepatitis, especially hepati-
tis B and hepatitis C, can cause postnecrotic cirrhosis.
This form of the disease affects up to 40% of all patients
who have cirrhosis.
Disorders like the inability to metabolize iron and
similar disorders may cause pigment cirrhosis (hemo-
chromatosis), which accounts for 5–10% of all instances
of the disease.

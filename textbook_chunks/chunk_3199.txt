• Insertion of a catheter or thin flexible tube to drain bile
and relieve obstruction. When performed by insertion
of a needle into the liver the technique is called percuta-
neous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD); when per-
formed endoscopically the catheter exits through the
nose and is called a nasobiliary drain.
• Balloons can be inserted into the ducts with either
method to dilate strictures.
• Insertion of a prosthesis which is a rigid or flexible tube
designed to keep a narrowed area open; it is usually
placed after a stricture is dilated with a balloon.
• Removal of stones can be accomplished most often by
endoscopic techniques. A number of methods have
been developed to perform this including laser and con-
tact lithotripsy in which stones are fragmented by
high-energy waves.

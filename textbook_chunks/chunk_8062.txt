Diabetes is suspected based on symptoms. Urine and
blood tests can be used to confirm a diagnose of diabetes
based on the amount of glucose. Urine tests can also
detect ketones and protein in the urine that may help
diagnose diabetes and assess how well the kidneys are
functioning. These tests can also be used to monitor the
disease once the patient is on a standardized diet, oral
medications, or insulin.

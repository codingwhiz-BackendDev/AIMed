After an animal passes feces that are infested with
hookworm eggs, the eggs hatch into infective larvae that
are able to penetrate human skin (even through solid
material, such as a beach towel). The larvae are common-
ly found in shaded, moist, or sandy areas (such as beach-
es, a childâ€™s sandbox, or areas underneath a house),
where they are easily picked up by bare feet or buttocks.
In minor infestations, there may be no symptoms at
all. In more severe cases, a red elevation of the skin
(papule) appears within a few hours after the larvae have
penetrated the skin. This usually arises first in areas that
are in contact with the soil, such as the feet, hands, and
buttocks.
Between a few days and a few months after infec-
tion, the larvae begin to migrate beneath the skin, leaving
extremely itchy red lines that may be accompanied by
blisters. These red lines usually appear at the top of the
sole of the foot or on the buttocks.
Tyically, the larvae travel through the bloodstream, to
the lungs, and then migrate into the mouth where they are
swallowed and attach to the small intestine lining. There
they mature into adult worms. In cases where the larvae
migrate through the lungs, they can produce anemia,
cough, and pneumonia, in addition to the itchy rash.

FMF is associated with high levels in the blood of
a protein called serum amyloid A (SAA). Over time,
excess SAA tends to be deposited in tissues and organs
throughout the body. The presence and deposition of
excess SAA is known as amyloidosis. Amyloidosis
may affect the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen,
heart, and testes, but effects on the kidneys are of
greatest concern. The frequency of amyloidosis varies
among the different ethnic groups, and its overall inci-
dence is difficult to determine because of the use of
colchicine to avert the problem. Left untreated, howev-
er, those individuals who do develop amyloidosis of
the kidneys may require a renal transplant, or may even
die of renal failure. The frequency and severity of a
personâ€™s attacks of fever and serositis seem to have no
relation to whether they will develop amyloidosis. In
fact, a few people with FMF have been described who
have had amyloidosis but apparently no other FMF-
related symptoms.

Glucocorticoids have multiple effects, and are used
for a large number of conditions. They affect glucose uti-
lization, fat metabolism, and bone development, and are
potent anti-inflammatory agents. They may be used for
replacement of natural hormones in patients with pitu-
itary deficiency (Addisonâ€™s disease), as well as for a
wide number of other conditions including, but not limit-
ed to, arthritis, asthma, anemia, various cancers, and
skin inflammations. Additional uses include inhibition of
nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy, treatment of
septic shock, treatment of spinal cord injuries, and treat-
ment of hirisutism (excessive hair growth). The choice of
drug will vary with the condition. Cortisone and hydro-
cortisone, which have both glucocorticoid and mineralo-
corticoid effects, are the drugs of choice for replacement
therapy of natural hormone deficiency. Synthetic com-
pounds, which have greater anti-inflammatory effects
and less effect on salt and water balance, are usually pre-
ferred for other purposes. These compounds include dex-
amethasone, which is almost exclusively glucocorticoid
in its actions, as well as prednisone, prednisolone,

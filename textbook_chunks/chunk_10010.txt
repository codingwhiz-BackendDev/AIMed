HYPERCALCEMIA. Blood calcium levels may be ele-
vated in cases of thyroid disorder, multiple myeloma,
metastatic cancer, multiple bone fractures, milk-alkali
syndrome, and Paget’s disease. Excessive use of calci-
um-containing supplements and certain over-the-counter
medications (i.e., antacids) may also cause hypercal-
cemia. Symptoms include:
• fatigue
• constipation
• depression
• confusion
• muscle pain
• nausea and vomiting
• dehydration
• increased urination
• irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
HYPOCALCEMIA. Thyroid disorders, kidney failure,
severe burns, sepsis, vitamin D deficiency, and medica-
tions such as heparin and glucogan can deplete blood cal-
cium levels. Lowered levels cause:
• muscle cramps and spasms
• tetany and/or convulsions
• mood changes (depression, irritability)
• dry skin

Food poisoning is almost entirely preventable by
practicing good sanitation and good food handling tech-
niques. These include:
• keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold
• cook meat to the recommended internal temperature,
use a meat thermometer to check and cook eggs until
they are no longer runny
• refrigerate leftovers promptly, do not let food stand at
room temperature
• avoid contaminating surfaces and other foods with the
juices of uncooked meats
• wash fruits and vegetables before using
• purchase pasteurized dairy products and fruit juices
• throw away bulging or leaking cans or any food that
smells spoiled
• wash hands well before and during food preparation
and after using the bathroom
• sanitize food preparation surfaces regularly

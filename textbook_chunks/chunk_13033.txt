When the doctor takes a complete medical history,
they will ask when the lump was first noticed, if there
were any symptoms or changes in lump size, and if there
is any personal or family history of breast disease.
The doctor thoroughly feels the breasts (palpates).
Tests are done, usually including mammography or
ultrasound scans, or surgical removal of cells or tissue
for examination under a the microscope (biopsy).

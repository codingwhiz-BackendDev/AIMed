Eating a balanced diet, including protein, complex car-
bohydrates, healthy fats, fresh fruits and vegetables, and
drinking eight to 10 glasses of water a day may stimulate
the body’s immune system and shorten the course of the
infection. Garlic (Allium sativum) and goldenseal
(Hydrastis canadensis), both antiseptic agents against staph
infections, may be taken. The daily dosage would vary
from person to person and is based on the severity of the
infection. Echinacea (Echinacea spp.) is helpful in modu-
lating immune function. Again, the dosage would vary.
Daily doses of 30–50 mg zinc and 1,000–5,000 mg
Vitamin C (taken in equal amounts at several times dur-
ing the day), and 300–2,000 mg bioflavinoids can also
strengthen the body’s infection-fighting ability. High
doses of vitamins and minerals should not be used with-
out a doctor’s approval.

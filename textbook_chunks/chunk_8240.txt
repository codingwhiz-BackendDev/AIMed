• Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A
continuous treatment that is self-administered and
requires no machine. The patient inserts fresh dialysate
solution into the abdominal cavity, waits four to six
hours, and removes the used solution. The solution is
immediately replaced with fresh dialysate. A bag
attached to the catheter is worn under clothing.
• Continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). An
overnight treatment that uses a machine to drain and
refill the abdominal cavity, CCPD takes 10–12 hours
per session.
• Intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD). This hospital-
based treatment is performed several times a week. A
machine administers and drains the dialysate solution,
and sessions can take up to 24 hours.
Peritoneal dialysis is often the treatment option of
choice in infants and children, whose small size can
make vascular (through a vein) access difficult to main-
tain. Peritoneal dialysis can also be done outside of a
clinical setting, which is more conducive to regular
school attendance.

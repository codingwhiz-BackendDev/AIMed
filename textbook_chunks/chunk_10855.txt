The prognosis for most enterobacterial infections is
good; most patients recover in about a week or 10 days
without needing antibiotics. HUS, on the other hand, has
a mortality rate of 3â€“5% even with intensive care. About
a third of the survivors have long-term problems with
kidney function, and another 8% develop high blood
pressure, seizure disorders, and blindness.

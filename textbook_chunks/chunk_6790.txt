The blue color of the skin and mucous membranes
is caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood. Low blood
oxygen may be caused by poor blood circulation, or
heart or breathing problems. It can also be caused by
being in a low-oxygen environment or by carbon
monoxide poisoning. More rarely, cyanosis can be pre-
sent at birth as a sign of congenital heart disease, in
which some of the blood is not pumped to the lungs
where oxygen would make the blood a bright red color.
Instead, the blood goes to the rest of the body and
remains unoxygenated. Cyanosis also may be caused by
poisoning from chemicals, drugs, or contaminated food
and water.
Other signs of low blood oxygen may accompany
cyanosis, including feeling lightheaded or fainting.

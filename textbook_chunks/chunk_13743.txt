During an average lifetime, each person walks about
115,000 miles and three-quarters of people have foot
problems at some point in their lives.
Foot problems can arise from wearing ill-fitting
shoes, from general wear and tear, as a result of injury, or
as a complication of disease. People with diabetes melli-
tus or circulatory diseases are 20 times more likely to
have foot problems than the general public.
Podiatrists are doctors who specialize in treating the
foot and ankle. Other doctors who have experience with
foot problems are family physicians, orthopedists, sports
medicine specialists, and those who care for diabetics.
Problems with the feet include foot pain, joint inflamma-
tion, plantar warts, fungal infections (like athleteâ€™s
foot), nerve disorders, torn ligaments, broken bones, bac-
terial infections, and tissue injuries (like frostbite).

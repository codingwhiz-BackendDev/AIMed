A patient needs to ask his or her health care
provider if any medication to be prescribed will cause
dry mouth. Patients with persistent xerostomia need to
practice good oral hygiene and visit a dentist on a regu-
lar basis; the lack of adequate saliva can cause severe
dental decay. The salivary glands are very sensitive to
radiation, so any patient scheduled for radiation thera-
py of the head and neck needs to discuss with the radia-
tion therapist ways to minimize exposure of the salivary
glands to radiation.

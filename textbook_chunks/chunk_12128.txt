About 25% of chalazia will disappear spontaneous-
ly, but hot compresses may speed the process. Because
chalazia are inside the lid, topical medications are gener-
ally of no benefit. Medication may need to be injected by
the doctor into the chalazion or if that doesnâ€™t help the
chalazion may need to be excised. If what appears to be a
chalazion recurs on the same site as any previous one, the
possibility of sebaceous gland carcinoma should be
investigated by biopsy.

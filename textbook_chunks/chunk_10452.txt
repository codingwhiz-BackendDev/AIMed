Doctors begin the diagnosis by taking a history, ask-
ing the patient about the symptoms mentioned above.
During a physical examination, the doctor may also
uncover signs such as fever, an enlarged spleen, signs of
kidney disease, or hemorrhaging. Listening to the
patient’s chest with a stethoscope, the doctor may also
hear a heart murmur. A heart murmur may indicate
abnormal flow of blood through one of the heart cham-
bers or valves.
Doctors take a sample of the patient’s blood to test it
for bacteria and other microorganisms that may be caus-
ing the infection. They usually also use a test called
echocardiography, which uses ultrasound waves to
make images of the heart, to check for abnormalities in
the structure of the heart wall or valves. One of the tell-
tale signs they look for in echocardiography is vegeta-
tion, the abnormal growth of tissue around a valve com-
posed of blood platelets, bacteria, and a clotting protein
called fibrin. Another tell-tale sign is regurgitation, or the
backward flow of blood, through one of the heart valves.
A normal echocardiogram does not exclude the possibili-
ty of endocarditis, but an abnormal echocardiogram can
confirm its presence. If an echocardiogram cannot be
done or its results are inconclusive, a modified technique
called transesophageal echocardiography is some-
times performed. Transesophageal echocardiography
involves passing an ultrasound device into the esophagus
to get a clearer image of the heart.

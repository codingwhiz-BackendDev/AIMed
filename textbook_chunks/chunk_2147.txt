Radiation therapy, which involves the use of high-
dosage x rays or other high-energy waves to kill cancer
cells, often is used for treating stages IB, IIA, and IIB
cervical cancers, or in combination with surgery. With
external-beam radiation therapy, the rays are focused on
the pelvic area from a source outside the body. With
implant or internal radiation therapy, a pellet of radioac-
tive material is placed internally, near the tumor. Alterna-
tively, thin needles may be used to insert the radioactive
material directly into the tumor.
Radiation therapy to the pelvic region can have
many side effects:
• skin reaction in the area of treatment
• fatigue
• upset stomach and loose bowels
• vaginal stenosis (narrowing of the vagina due to build-
up of scar tissue) leading to painful sexual intercourse
• premature menopause in young women
• problems with urination

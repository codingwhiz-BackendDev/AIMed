The rapid rewarming approach to frostbite treatment,
pioneered in the 1980s, has proved to be much more
effective than older methods in preventing tissue loss and
amputation. A study of 56 first-, second-, and third-degree
frostbite patients treated with rapid rewarming in
1982–85 found that 68% recovered without tissue loss,
25% experienced some tissue loss, and 7% needed ampu-
tation. In a comparison group of 98 patients, treatment
using older methods resulted in a tissue loss rate of nearly
35% and an amputation rate of nearly 33%. Although the
comparison group included a higher proportion of sec-
ond- and third-degree cases, the difference in treatment
results was determined to be statistically significant.
The extreme throbbing pain that many frostbite suf-
ferers endure for days or weeks after rewarming is not
the only prolonged symptom of frostbite. During the first
weeks or months, people often experience tingling, a
burning sensation, or a sensation resembling shocks from
an electric current. Other possible consequences of frost-
bite include skin—color changes, nail deformation or
loss, joint stiffness and pain, hyperhidrosis (excessive
sweating), and heightened sensitivity to cold. For every-
one, a degree of sensory loss lasting at least four years—
and sometimes a lifetime—is inevitable.

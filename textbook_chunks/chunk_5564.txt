There are a number of pathologies and diseases that
can lead to joint contractures. The primary causes result-
ing in a joint contraction are muscle imbalance, pain,
prolonged bed rest, and immobilization. Because of the
frequency of fractures and surgery, immobilization is
the most frequent cause of joint contractures. Symptoms
include a significant loss of motion to any specific joint
that results in immobility. If the contracture is of a signif-
icant degree, pain can result even without any voluntary
joint movement.

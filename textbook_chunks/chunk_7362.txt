People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take decongestants. Before taking these drugs, be sure to
let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to decongestants in the past should let his or her physi-
cian know before these drugs or any similar drugs are
prescribed. The physician should also be told about any
allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub-
stances.
PREGNANCY. In studies of laboratory animals, some
decongestants have had unwanted effects on fetuses.
However, it is not known whether such effects also occur
in people. Women who are pregnant or who plan to
become pregnant should check with their physicians
before taking decongestants.
BREASTFEEDING. Some decongestants pass into
breast milk and may have unwanted effects on nursing
babies whose mothers take the drugs. Women who are
breastfeeding should check with their physicians before
using decongestants. If they need to take the medicine, it
may be necessary to bottle feed the baby with formula
while taking it.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Anyone with heart
or blood vessel disease, high blood pressure, diabetes,
enlarged prostate, or overactive thyroid should not take
decongestants unless under a physician’s supervision.
The medicine can increase blood sugar in people with
diabetes. It can be especially dangerous in people with
high blood pressure, as it may increase blood pressure.
Before using decongestants, people with any of
these medical problems should make sure their physi-
cians are aware of their conditions:
• glaucoma
• history of mental illness
Decongestants may have a variety of side effects,
and may also interact with other medications the patient
is taking.

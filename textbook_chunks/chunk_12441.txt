Fanconi’s syndrome can be reversible. Fanconi’s
syndrome caused by kidney transplantation usually
reverses itself within the first year after transplant
surgery. When caused by a toxin in the environment,
Fanconi’s syndrome generally can be reversed by remov-
ing the causative agent from the patient’s environment. If
it is caused by a genetic disease, it can usually be
reversed by treating the disease. However, if Fanconi’s
syndrome is not treated or if treatment is unsuccessful,
the kidneys can fail.

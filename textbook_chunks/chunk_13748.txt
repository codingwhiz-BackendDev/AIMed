Daily foot care for people likely to develop foot
problems includes washing the feet in tepid water with
mild soap and oiling the feet with vegetable oil or a lano-
lin-based lotion. Toenails should be cut straight across
above the level of the skin after soaking the feet in tepid
water. Corns and calluses should not be cut. If they need
removal, it should be done under the care of a doctor.
Athletes foot and plantar warts should also be treated by
a doctor if they develop in high risk patients.
Many people with diabetes or circulatory disorders
have problems with cold feet. These problems can be
reduced by avoiding smoking tobacco (smoking con-
stricts the blood vessels), wearing warm socks, not cross-
ing the legs while sitting or not sitting in one position too
long, or avoiding constricting stockings.
People with circulatory problems should not use heat-
ing pads or hot water bottles on their feet, as even moder-
ate heat can damage the skin if circulation is impaired.

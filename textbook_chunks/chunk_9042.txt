While many victims of drug overdose recover with-
out long term effects, there can be serious consequences.
Some drug overdoses cause the failure of major organs
like the kidneys or liver, or failure of whole systems like
the respiratory or circulatory systems. Patients who sur-
vive drug overdose may need kidney dialysis, kidney or
liver transplant, or ongoing care as a result of heart fail-
ure, stroke, or coma. Death can occur in almost any drug
overdose situation, particularly if treatment is not started
immediately.

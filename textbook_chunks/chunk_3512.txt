Cholinergic drugs produce the same effects as acetyl-
choline. Acetylcholine is the most common neurohor-
mone of the parasympathetic nervous system, the part of
the peripheral nervous system responsible for the every
day work of the body. While the sympathetic nervous sys-
tem acts during times of excitation, the parasympathetic
system deals with everyday activities such as salivation,
digestion, and muscle relaxation.
The cholinergic drugs may be used in several ways.
The cholinergic muscle stimulants are used to diagnose and
treat myathenia gravis, a disease that causes severe muscle
weakness. This class of drugs includes ambenonium chlo-
ride (Mytelase), edrophonium chloride (Tensilon), neostig-
mine (Prostigmine), and piridogstimina (Mestin√≥n). These
drugs are also widely used in surgery, both to reduce the
risk of urinary retention, and to reverse the effects of the
muscle relaxant drugs that are used in surgery.
Cholinergic drugs are also used in control of glauco-
ma, a disease that is caused by increased pressure inside
the eye. The most common drugs used for this purpose
are demecarium (Humorsol) and echthiophate (Phospho-
line iodide).

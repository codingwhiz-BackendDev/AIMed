The physiology of fasting has been widely studied
and documented by medical science. Beneficial effects
such as lowered cholesterol and improved general func-
tioning have been shown. Fasting as a treatment for ill-
ness and disease has been studied less, although some
studies around the world have shown beneficial results. A
1984 study showed that workers in Taiwan who had
severe chemical poisoning had dramatic improvement
after a ten-day fast. In Russia and Japan, studies have
demonstrated fasting to be an effective treatment for men-
tal illness. Fasting has been featured on the cover of med-
ical journals, although mainstream medicine has general-
ly ignored fasting and detoxification treatments as valid
medical procedures.

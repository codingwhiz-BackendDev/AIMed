Autopsy after death is a way to precisely determine
a cause of death. The word autopsy is derived from
Greek meaning to see with oneâ€™s own eyes. A pathologist
extensively examines a body and submits a detailed
report to an attending physician. Although an autopsy
can do nothing for an individual after death, it can benefit
the family and, in some cases, medical science. Heredi-
tary disorders and disease may be found. This knowledge
could be used to prevent illness in other family members.
Information culled from an autopsy can be used to fur-
ther medical research. The link between smoking and
lung cancer was confirmed from data gathered through
autopsy. Early information about AIDS was also com-
piled through autopsy reports.

Spasticity, muscle weakness, coordination, ataxia,
and scoliosis are all significant impairments that affect the
posture and mobility of a person with CP. Physical and
occupational therapists work with the patient, and the fam-
ily, to maximize the ability to move affected limbs, devel-
op normal motor patterns, and maintain posture. “Assistive
technology,” things such as wheelchairs, walkers, shoe
inserts, crutches, and braces, are often required. A speech
therapist, and high-tech aids such as computer-controlled
communication devices, can make a tremendous differ-
ence in the life of those who have speech impairments.

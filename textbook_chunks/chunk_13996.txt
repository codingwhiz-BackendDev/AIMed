route. Treatment begins by rewarming the affected part
for 15–30 minutes in water at a temperature of
104–108°F (40–42.2°C). This rapid rewarming halts ice
crystal formation and dilates narrowed blood vessels.
Aloe vera (which acts against inflammatory mediators) is
applied to the affected part, which is then splinted, ele-
vated, and wrapped in a dressing. Depending on the
extent of injury, blisters may be debrided (cleaned by
removing foreign material) or simply covered with aloe
vera. A tetanus shot and, possibly, penicillin, are used to
prevent infection, and the patient is given ibuprofen to
combat inflammation. Narcotics are needed in most
cases to reduce the excruciating pain that occurs as sen-
sation returns during rewarming. Except when injury is
minimal, treatment generally requires a hospital stay of
several days, during which hydrotherapy and physical
therapy are used to restore the affected part to health.
Experts recommend a cautious approach to tissue
removal, and advise that 22–45 days must pass before a
decision on amputation can safely be made.

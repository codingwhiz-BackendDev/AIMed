Endometrial biopsy (the removal and examination
of endometrial tissue) is the most important testing proce-
dure. It allows the doctor to sample small areas of the uter-
ine lining, while cervical biopsy allows the cervix to be
sampled. Tissues are then examined for any abnormalities.
Dilation and curettage (D & C), once common is
rarely done today for diagnosis of DUB. It is done while
the patient is under either general or regional anesthesia.
Women over 30 are more likely to need a D & C, as part
of the diagnostic procedure, than younger women.
Because DUB is diagnosed by eliminating other
possible disorders, diagnosis can take a long time and
involve many tests and procedures. Older women are
likely to need more extensive tests than adolescents
because the likelihood of reproductive cancers is greater
in this age group, and therefore must be definitively
eliminated before treating bleeding symptoms.

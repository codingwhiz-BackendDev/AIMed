CT is used in the process of performing a biopsy,
such as a needle biopsy, in order to guide the needle to
the site of the biopsy and to provide rapid and precise
localization of the needle. CT enables imaging of areas
that are normally beyond visible boundaries. This
enables the physician to see the target area clearly and
help to ensure that the tissue being removed is from the
target lesion.

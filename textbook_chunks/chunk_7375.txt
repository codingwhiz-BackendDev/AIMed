Anyone considering taking a decongestant should
take a close look at the labels of any already in their med-
icine cabinet. In 2000, the Food and Drug Administration
prohibited over-the-counter sales of medicines contain-
ing the decongestant phenylpropanolamine. The medi-
cine is associated with an increased risk of stroke in peo-
ple ages 18 to 49, especially women. Many cold reme-
dies contained this medicine. Contact a pharmacist if
there is any question about the ingredients in a medica-
tion. Over-the-counter remedies containing phenyl-
propanolamine should be discarded.

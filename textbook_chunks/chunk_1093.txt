Celiac disease—A disease, occurring in both chil-
dren and adults, which is caused by a sensitivity to
gluten, a protein found in grains. It results in
chronic inflammation and shrinkage of the lining
of the small intestine.
Digestion—The mechanical, chemical, and enzy-
matic process in which food is converted into the
materials suitable for use by the body.
Enzyme—A substance produced by the body to
assist in a chemical reaction. In carbohydrate
intolerance, lack of an enzyme makes it impossi-
ble for one type of sugar to be broken down into a
simpler form so that it can be absorbed by the
intestines and used by the body.
Metabolism—All the physical and chemical
changes that take place within an organism.
Nutrient—Food or another substance that supplies
the body with the elements needed for metabolism.
Sugars—Those carbohydrates having the general
composition of one part carbon, two parts hydro-
gen, and one part oxygen.
and carried by the bloodstream into the lungs where it
is exhaled. Normally there is very little hydrogen
detectable in the breath, so its presence indicates faulty
digestion of lactose.
When lactose intolerance is suspected in infants and
young children, many pediatricians recommend simply
changing from cow’s milk to soy formula and watching
for improvement. If needed, a stool sample can be tested
for acidity. The inadequate digestion of lactose will result
in an increase of acid in the waste matter excreted by the
bowels and the presence of glucose.

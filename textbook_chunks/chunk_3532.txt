Cholinergic—Nerves that are stimulated by acetyl-
choline.
Glaucoma—a disease of the eye marked by
increased pressure within the eyeball that can
result in damage to the optic disk and gradual loss
of vision.
Myasthenia gravis—a disease characterized by pro-
gressive weakness and exhaustibility of voluntary
muscles without atrophy or sensory disturbance
and caused by an autoimmune attack on acetyl-
choline receptors at neuromuscular junctions.
Parasympathetic nervous system—the part of the
nervous system that contains chiefly cholinergic
fibers, that tends to induce secretion, to increase
the tone and contractility of smooth muscle, and
to slow the heart rate.

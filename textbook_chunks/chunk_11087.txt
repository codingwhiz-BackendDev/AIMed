Epididymitis is the most common cause of pain in
the scrotum. The acute form is usually associated with
the most severe pain and swelling. If symptoms last for
more than six weeks after treatment begins, the condition
is considered chronic.
Epididymitis can occur any time after the onset of
puberty but is most common between the ages of 18 and
40. It is especially common among members of the mili-
tary who exercise for extended periods without emptying
their bladders.
Factors that increase the risk of developing epi-
didymitis include:
• infection of the bladder, kidney, prostate, or urinary tract
• other recent illness

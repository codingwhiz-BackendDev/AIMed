A healthy lifestyle can help prevent coronary artery
disease and help keep it from progressing. A heart-
healthy lifestyle includes eating right, regular exercise,
maintaining a healthy weight, no smoking, moderate
drinking, no recreational drugs, controlling hypertension,
and managing stress. Cardiac rehabilitation programs
are excellent to help prevent recurring coronary problems
for people who are at risk and who have had coronary
events and procedures.

terminal and treatments are directed to improve quality
of life for the remaining time and to minimize emotional
suffering associated with pain.

A careful history is necessary to assess duration, sever-
ity, and location of pain. A physical examination may ver-
ify the presence of pain. Imaging analysis may further con-
firm the presence of potential causes of pain. The World
Health Organization (WHO) recommends an analgesic lad-
der. This treatment approach provides medication selec-
tions based on previous analgesic use and severity of pain.
The ladder starts with the use of non-opioid (non-mor-
phine) drugs such as aspirin, acetaminophin, or non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory medications for control of mild
pain. Chronic pain must be treated with constant and con-
sistently administered medication(s). The “take as needed”
approach is not advised. Supplemental doses may be rec-
ommended in addition to the standard dose for circum-
stances that may worsen pain. Opioids (i.e., morphine and
codeine) are the medications of choice for moderate to
severe pain. Doses are adjusted to produce maximum pain
relief while minimizing side effects. These medications are
conveniently administered orally. Administering steroids
can help reduce nausea and vomiting. Delirium and anxi-
ety may be improved by psychoactive medications.

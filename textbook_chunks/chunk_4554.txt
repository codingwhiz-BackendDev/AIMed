It may be advisable to use a probiotic pessary after
colonic irrigation, to ensure replacement of desirable nat-
ural flora. There are certain conditions that either partly
or completely preclude the use of colonic irrigation, such
as an active attack of Crohnâ€™s disease, bleeding ulcers,
and hyperacidosis. If in doubt, a qualified practitioner
should be consulted. Anyone suffering from these condi-
tions should always notify the practitioner when receiv-
ing colonic irrigation treatments.

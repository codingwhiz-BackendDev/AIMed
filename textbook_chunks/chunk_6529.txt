Once cryptococcosis is diagnosed, treatment begins
with amphotericin B (Fungizone), sometimes in combi-
nation with 5-flucytosine (Ancobon). Amphotericin B is
a powerful fungistatic drug with potentially toxic side
effects, such as kidney toxicity and lower concentrations
of an important blood component called hemoglobin.
This medication can also cause fever, chills, nausea and
vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and muscle aches. Treat-
ment is generally given intravenously during a hospital
stay and continues until the patient is stable or improving
(no more than two to three weeks). 5-flucytosine is given
orally. Patients may also receive other medication to
minimize the side effects from these drugs.
Amphotericin B, with or without 5-flucytosine, is
given for several weeks until the patient is stable, after
which the patient receives oral fluconazole (Diflucan).
Fluconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal drug with few
serious side effects. Patient with AIDS must continue tak-
ing fluconazole for the rest of their lives to prevent a
relapse of cryptococcosis. Sometimes fluconazole is
given to patients with advanced AIDS as a preventative
(prophylactic) measure.
Because of the high cost of fluconazole, the manu-
facturer of the drug, Pfizer, has established a financial
assistance plan to make the drug available at lower cost
to those who meet certain criteria. Patients needing this
drug should ask their doctors about this program.

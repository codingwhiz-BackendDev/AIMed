People with CF usually require high-calorie diets
and vitamin supplements. Height, weight, and growth of
a person with CF are monitored regularly. Most people
with CF need to take pancreatic enzymes to supplement
or replace the inadequate secretions of the pancreas.
Tablets containing pancreatic enzymes are taken with
every meal; depending on the size of the tablet and the
meal, as many as 20 tablets may be needed. Because of
incomplete absorption even with pancreatic enzymes, a
person with CF needs to take in about 30% more food
than a person without CF. Low-fat diets are not recom-
mended except in special circumstances, since fat is a
source of both essential fatty acids and abundant calories.
Some people with CF cannot absorb enough nutri-
ents from the foods they eat, even with specialized diets
and enzymes. For these people, tube feeding is an option.
Nutrients can be introduced directly into the stomach
through a tube inserted either through the nose (a naso-
gastric tube) or through the abdominal wall (a gastrosto-
my tube). A jejunostomy tube, inserted into the small
intestine, is also an option. Tube feeding can provide
nutrition at any time, including at night while the person
is sleeping, allowing constant intake of high-quality
nutrients. The feeding tube may be removed during the
day, allowing normal meals to be taken.

Most benign breast conditions carry no increased
risk for the development of breast cancer. However, a
small percentage of biopsies uncover overgrowth of tis-
sue in a particular pattern in some women; this pattern
indicates a 15â€“20% increased risk of breast cancer over
the next 20 years. Strict attention to early detection mea-
sures, such as annual mammograms, is especially impor-
tant for these women.

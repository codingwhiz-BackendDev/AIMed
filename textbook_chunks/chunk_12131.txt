Blepharitis is treated with hot compresses, with
antibiotic ointment, and by cleaning the eyelids with a
moist washcloth and then with baby shampoo. Good
hygiene is essential. If the blepharitis doesnâ€™t clear up
with treatment or if it seems to be a chronic problem, the
patient may have acnerosacea. These patients may need
to see a dermatologist as well.

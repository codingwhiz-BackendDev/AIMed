Using the external fetal monitor is simple and painless.
Two elastic belts are placed around the mother’s abdomen.
One belt holds a listening device in place while the other
belt holds the contraction monitor. The nurse or midwife
adjusts the belts to get the best readings from each device.
Sometimes, it is difficult to hear the baby’s heartbeat
with the external monitoring device. Other times, the
monitor may show subtle signs of a developing problem.
In either case, the doctor or midwife may recommend that
the external belt be replaced with an internal monitor.
The internal monitor is an electronic wire that rests
directly on the baby’s head. The provider can place it on
the baby’s head during an internal exam. The internal
monitor can only be used when the cervix is already
open. This device provides a more accurate record of the
baby’s heart rate.

Diagnosis of CMT begins with a careful neurological
exam to determine the extent and distribution of weakness. A
thorough family history should be taken at this time to deter-
mine if other people in the family are affected. Testing may
also be performed to rule out other causes of neuropathy.
A nerve conduction velocity test should be per-
formed to measure how fast impulses travel through the
nerves. This test may show characteristic features of
CMT, but it is not diagnostic of CMT. Nerve conduction
testing may be combined with electromyography
(EMG), an electrical test of the muscles.
A nerve biopsy (removal of a small piece of the
nerve) may be performed to look for changes characteris-
tic of CMT. However, this testing is not diagnostic of
CMT and is usually not necessary for making a diagnosis.
Definitive diagnosis of CMT is made only by genet-
ic testing, usually performed by drawing a small amount
of blood. As of early 2001, testing is available to detect
mutations in PMP22, MPZ, Cx32 and EGR2. However,
research is progressing rapidly and new testing is often
made available every few months. All affected members
of a family have the same type of CMT. Therefore once a
mutation is found in one affected member, it is possible
to test other members who may have symptoms or are at
risk of developing CMT.

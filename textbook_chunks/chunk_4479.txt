The colon is a tubular organ beginning in the right
lower aspect of the abdomen. Anatomically, it ascends on
the right side of the abdomen, traverses from right to left
in the upper abdomen, descends vertically down the left
side, takes an S-shaped curve in the lower left abdomen,
and then flows into the rectum as it leaves the abdomen
for the pelvis. These portions of the colon are named sep-
arately though they are part of the same organ:
• cecum, the beginning of the colon
• ascending colon, the right vertical ascent of the colon
• transverse colon, the portion traversing from right to left
• descending colon, the left vertical descent of the colon
• sigmoid colon, the s-shaped segment of colon above the
pelvis

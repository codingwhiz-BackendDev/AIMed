Cochlear implants stimulate nerve ends within the
inner ear, enabling deaf children to hear. The device has a
microphone that remains outside the ear, a processor that
selects and codes speech sounds, and a receiver/stimulator
to convert the coded sounds to electric signals that stimulate
the hearing nerve and are recognized by the brain as sound.
During surgery, an incision is made behind and slightly
above the ear. A circular hole is drilled in the bone to receive
the deviceâ€™s internal coil. The mastoid bone leading to the
middle ear is opened to receive the electrodes. The internal
coil is inserted and secured, followed by the electrodes. The
wound is stitched up and when it heals, an external unit
comprised of a stimulator with a microphone is worn
behind the ear. Performed in a hospital under general anes-
thesia, the operation takes about two hours and usually
requires a hospital stay overnight. The patient can resume
normal activities in two to three weeks.

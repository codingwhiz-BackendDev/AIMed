Eosinophilia is an increase in the number of
eosinophils. Eosinophilic pneumonia is characterized
by a large number of eosinophils in the lungs, usually in
the absence of an infectious disease. Eosinophils are
one of the white blood cells and are classified as a gran-
ulocyte. They are part of the non-specific immune sys-
tem and participate in inflammatory reactions.
Eosinophils contain cationic molecules that are useful
for destroying infectious agents, especially heiminthic
parasites (worms). There are several types of
eosinophilic pneumonia. Loffler’s pneumonia is a tem-
porary infiltration of eosinophils into the lungs. The
patient will feel tired, have a cough, spasms of the
bronchial airway, and difficulty breathing. Loffler’s
pneumonia will clear spontaneously, but slowly over
the course of about a month. Another form of
eosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary infiltrates with
eosinophilia (PIE), is a more serious and potentially
fatal disease. In PIE, the patient experiences asthma,
pulmonary infiltrates, disorders of the peripheral ner-
vous system, central nervous systems symptoms, and
periarteritis nodosa.

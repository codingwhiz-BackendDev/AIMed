It is very important for those attending a person with
concussion to pay close attention to the personâ€™s symp-
toms and progression immediately after the accident. The
duration of unconsciousness and degree of confusion are
very important indicators of the severity of the injury and
help guide the diagnostic process and treatment decisions.
A doctor, nurse, or emergency medical technician
may make an immediate assessment based on the severi-
ty of the symptoms; a neurologic exam of the pupils,
coordination, and sensation; and brief tests of orienta-
tion, memory, and concentration. Those with very mild
concussions may not need to be hospitalized or have
expensive diagnostic tests. Questionable or more severe
cases may require computed tomography scan (CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to look for
brain injury.

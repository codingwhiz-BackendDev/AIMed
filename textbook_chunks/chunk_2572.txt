Side effects of chelation therapy are reportedly
unusual, but are occasionally serious. Mild reactions may
include, but are not limited to, local irritation at the infu-
sion site, skin reactions, nausea, headache, dizziness,
hypoglycemia, fever, leg cramps, or loose bowel move-
ments. Some of the more serious complications reported
have included hypocalcemia, kidney damage, decreased
clotting ability, anemia, bone marrow damage, insulin
shock, thrombophlebitis with embolism, and even rare
deaths. However, some doctors feel that the latter groups
of complications occurred before the safer method cur-
rently used for chelation therapy was developed.

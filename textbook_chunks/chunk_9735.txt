Dislocation of the hip joint typically accompanies
arthrochalasia type EDS, formerly called EDS type VIIB.
Other joints are also unusually loose, leading to recurrent
partial and total dislocations. The skin has a high degree
of stretchability and bruises easily. Individuals with this
type of EDS may also experience mildly diminished
bone mass, scoliosis, and poor muscle tone. Arthrochala-
sia type is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
There are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS arthrochalasia type. These include sever general-
ized joing hypermobility and bilateral hip dislocation
present at birth. This form of EDS is caused by a change
in either of two components of Collage type I, called
proa1(I) type A and proa2(I) type B. A skin biopsy may
be preformed to demonstrate an abnormality in either
components. Direct DNA testing is also available.

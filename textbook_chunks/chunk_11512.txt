The most common operations for the treatment of
esophageal cancer are esophagectomy and esophagogas-
trectomy. Esophagectomy is the removal of the cancer-
ous part of the esophagus and nearby lymph nodes. This
procedure is performed only on patients with very early
cancer that has not spread to the stomach. Esophagogas-
trectomy is the removal of the cancerous part of the
esophagus, nearby lymph nodes, and the upper part of
the stomach. The resected esophagus is replaced with the
stomach or parts of intestine so the patient can swallow.
These procedures can significantly relieve symptoms and
improve the nutritional status of more than 80% of
patients with dysphagia. Although surgery can cure some
patients whose disease has not spread beyond the esoph-
agus, but more than 75% of esophageal cancers have
spread to other organs before being diagnosed. Less
extensive surgical procedures can be used for palliation.

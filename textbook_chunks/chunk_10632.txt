ERUS is used as a diagnostic procedure in rectal
cancer to determine stage of the tumor and as a postradi-
ation, presurgical examination to assess extent of tumor
shrinkage. ERUS can also be used in cases of anal fistula
(an abnormal passage) and problems with the anal
sphincter muscles (muscles that control the opening and
closing of the anus).

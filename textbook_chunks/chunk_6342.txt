There is no known way to prevent sporadic CJD, by
far the most common type. Not everyone who inherits
the gene mutation for familial CJD will develop the dis-
ease, but at present, there is no known way to predict
who will and who wonâ€™t succumb. The incidence of
iatrogenic CJD has fallen with recognition of its sources,
the development of better screening techniques for
infected tissue, and the use of sterilization techniques for
surgical instruments that inactivate prion proteins.
Strategies for prevention of vCJD are a controversial
matter, as they involve a significant sector of the agricul-
tural industry and a central feature of the diet in many
countries. The infectious potential of contaminated meat
is unknown, because the ability to detect prions within
meat is limited. Surveillance of North American herds
strongly suggests there is no BSE here, and strict regula-
tions on imports of European livestock make future out-
breaks highly unlikely. Therefore, avoidance of all meat

originating in North America, simply on grounds of BSE
risk, is a personal choice unsupported by current data.
The ban on the export of British beef continues in coun-
tries of the European Union, although some herds in these
countries have developed low levels of infection as well.

People allergic to certain plastics should not wear
contact lenses or eyeglass frames or lenses manufactured
from that type of plastic. People allergic to nickel should
not wear Flexon frames. People at risk of being in acci-
dents that might shatter glass lenses should wear plastic
lenses, preferably polycarbonate. (Lenses made from
polycarbonate, the same type of plastic used for the
space shuttle windshield, are about 50 times stronger
than other lens materials.) Also, people at risk of receiv-
ing electric shock should avoid metal frames.
People employed in certain occupations may be pro-
hibited from wearing contact lenses, or may be required
to wear safety eyewear over the contact lenses. Some
occupations, such as construction or auto repair, may
require safety lenses and safety frames. Physicians and
employers should be consulted for recommendations.

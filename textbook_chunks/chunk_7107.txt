Depending on the type of information needed from a
cystoscopy, the procedure typically takes 10â€“40 minutes
to complete. The patient will be asked to urinate before
surgery which allows an accurate measurement of the
remaining urine in the bladder. A well lubricated cysto-
scope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder
where a urine sample is taken. Fluid is then pushed in to
inflate the bladder and allow the urologist to examine the
entire bladder wall.
During an examination, the urologist may take the fol-
lowing steps: remove either bladder or kidney stones; gather
tissue samples; and treat any suspicious lesions. In order to
perform x-ray studies (retrograde pyelogram), a harmless
dye is injected into the ureters by way of a catheter that is
passed through the previously placed cystoscope. After
completion of all needed tests, the cystoscope is removed.

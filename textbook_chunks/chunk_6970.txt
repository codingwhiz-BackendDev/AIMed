No treatment can decrease cystine excretion. The
best treatment for cystinuria is to prevent stones from
forming. Stones can be prevented by drinking enough
liquid each day (about 5–7 qts) to produce at least 8 pts
of urine, thus keeping the concentration of cystine in the
urine low. Because a person doesn’t drink throughout the
night, less urine is produced, and the likelihood of stone
formation increases. This risk can be minimized by
drinking water or other liquids just before going to bed.

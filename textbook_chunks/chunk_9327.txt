Simply changing the position of the body can help
ease cramps. The simplest technique is assuming the
fetal position, with knees pulled up to the chest while
hugging a heating pad or pillow to the abdomen. Like-
wise, several yoga positions are popular ways to ease
menstrual pain. In the “cat stretch,” position, the woman
rests on her hands and knees, slowly arching the back.
The pelvic tilt is another popular yoga position, in which
the woman lies with knees bent, and then lifts the pelvis
and buttocks.
Dietary recommendations to ease cramps include
increasing fiber, calcium, and complex carbohydrates,
cutting fat, red meat, dairy products, caffeine, salt, and
sugar. Smoking also has been found to worsen cramps.
Recent research suggests that vitamin B supplements,
primarily vitamin B6 in a complex, magnesium, and fish
oil supplements (omega-3 fatty acids) also may help
relieve cramps.
Other women find relief through visualization, con-
centrating on the pain as a particular color and gaining
control of the sensations. Aromatherapy and massage
may ease pain for some women. Others find that imagin-
ing a white light hovering over the painful area can actu-
ally lessen the pain for brief periods.
Exercise may be a way to reduce the pain of men-
strual cramps through the brain’s production of endor-
phins, the body’s own painkillers. And orgasm can make
a woman feel more comfortable by releasing tension in
the pelvic muscles.
Acupuncture and Chinese herbs are another popu-
lar alternative treatments for cramps.

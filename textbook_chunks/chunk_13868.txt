of fractures usually begin with pain that
increases with attempted movement or use of the area
and swelling at the involved site. The skin in the area
may be pale and an obvious deformity may be present. In
more severe cases, there may be a loss of pulse below the
fracture site, such as in the extremities, accompanied by
numbness, tingling, or paralysis below the fracture. An
open or compound fracture is often accompanied by
bleeding or bruising. If the lower limbs or pelvis are frac-
tured, pain and resistance to movement usually accompa-
ny the injury causing difficulty with weight bearing.

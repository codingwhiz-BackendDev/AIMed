Epidermis—The outermost layer of the skin.
Keratin—A tough, nonwater-soluble protein found

feet. Other forms of EB simplex can lead to more wide-
spread blistering, as well as hair loss and missing teeth.
Recurrent blistering is annoying but not life threatening.
The second, or junctional, form of EB does not lead to
scarring. However, skin on the areas prone to blistering,
such as elbows and knees, often shrinks. In one variation
of junctional EB, called gravis junctional EB of Herlitz,
the blistering can be so severe that affected infants may not
survive due to massive infection and dehydration.
The third form of EB, dystrophic EB, varies greatly
in terms of severity, but more typically affects the arms
and legs. In one variation, called Hallopeau-Siemens EB,
repeated blistering and scarring of the hands and feet
causes the fingers and toes to fuse, leaving them dysfunc-
tional and with a mitten-like appearance.

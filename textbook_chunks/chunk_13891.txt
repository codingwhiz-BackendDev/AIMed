In addition to the importance of calcium for strong
bones, many alternative treatment approaches recom-
mend use of mineral supplements to help build and main-
tain a healthy, resilient skeleton. Some physical thera-
pists use electro-stimulation over a fractured site to pro-
mote and expedite healing. Chinese traditional medicine
may be helpful by working to reconnect chi through the
meridian lines along the line of a fracture. Homeopathy
can enhance the bodyâ€™s healing process. Two particularly
useful homeopathic remedies are Arnica (Arnica mon-
tana) and Symphytum (Symphytum officinalis). If possi-
ble, applying contrast hydrotherapy to an extremity
(e.g., a hand or foot) of a fractured area can assist healing
by enhancing circulation.

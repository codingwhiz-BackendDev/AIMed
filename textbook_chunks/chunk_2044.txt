During a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, a procedure in which cerebrospinal fluid is aspirated, the physician inserts a hollow,
thin needle in the space between two vertebrae of the lower back and slowly advances it toward the spine.The cerebrospinal
fluid pressure is then measured and the fluid is withdrawn for laboratory analysis. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
ble between the lower vertebrae, or bones of the back, for
the doctor to insert a lumbar puncture needle between the
vertebrae and withdraw a small amount of fluid. The most
common position is for the patient to lie on his or her side
with the back at the edge of the exam table, head and chin
bent down, knees drawn up to the chest, and arms clasped
around the knees. (Small infants and people who are obese
may need to curve their spines in a sitting position.) Peo-
ple should talk to their doctor if they have any questions
about their position because it is important to be comfort-
able and to remain still during the entire procedure. In fact,
the doctor will explain the procedure to the patient (or
guardian) so that the patient can agree in writing to have it
done (informed consent). If the patient is anxious or unco-
operative, a short-acting sedative may be given.
During a lumbar puncture, the doctor drapes the
back with a sterile covering that has an opening over the
puncture site and cleans the skin surface with an antisep-
tic solution. Patients receive a local anesthetic to mini-
mize any pain in the lower back.

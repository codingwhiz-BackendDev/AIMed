Since HPV is a sexually-transmitted infection, sexu-
al behaviors can put women at risk for HPV infection
and cervical cancer. These behaviors include:
• sexual intercourse at age 16 or younger
• partners who began having intercourse at a young age
• multiple sexual partners
• sexual partners who have had multiple partners (“high-
risk males”)
• a partner who has had a previous sexual partner with
cervical cancer
HPV infection may not produce any symptoms, so
sexual partners may not know that they are infected.
However, Pap tests can detect the infection. Condoms do
not necessarily prevent HPV infection.
Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) is a risk factor for cervical cancer. Women who
test positive for HIV may have impaired immune sys-
tems that cannot correct precancerous conditions. Fur-
thermore, sexual behavior that puts women at risk for
HIV infection, also puts them at risk for HPV infection.
There is some evidence suggesting that another sexually
transmitted virus, the genital herpes virus, also may be
involved in cervical cancer.

polyposis colorectal cancer gene have a higher risk of
developing endometrial cancer.
• Breast, ovarian, or colon cancer. Women who have a
history of these other types of cancer are at an increased
risk of developing endometrial cancer.
• Low parity or nulliparity. Endometrial cancer is more
common in women who have born few (low parity) or
no (nulliparity) children. The high levels of proges-
terone produced during pregnancy has a protective
effect against endometrial cancer. The results of one
study suggest that nulliparity is associated with a lower
survival rate.
• Infertility. Risk is increased due to nulliparity or the use
of fertility drugs.
• Polycystic ovary syndrome. The increased level of
estrogen associated with this abnormality raises the risk
of cancers of the breast and endometrium.
The most common symptom of endometrial cancer
is unusual vaginal spotting, bleeding, or discharge. In
women who are near menopause (perimenopausal),
symptoms of endometrial cancer could include bleeding
between periods (intermenstrual bleeding), heavy bleed-
ing that lasts for more than seven days, or short menstru-
al cycles (fewer than 21 days). For women who have
gone through menopause, any vaginal bleeding or abnor-
mal discharge is suspect. Pain in the pelvic region and
the presence of a lump (mass) are symptoms that occur
late in the disease.

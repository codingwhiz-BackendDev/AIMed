humans. However, in studies of laboratory animals, large
doses of these drugs have been reported to cause birth
defects, stillbirth, poor bone growth, and other problems
when taken during pregnancy. Women who are pregnant
or who may become pregnant should check with their
physicians before using these drugs.
BREASTFEEDING. Some calcium channel blockers
pass into breast milk, but there have been no reports of
problems in nursing babies whose mothers were taking
this type of medication. However, women who need to
take this medicine and want to breastfeed their babies
should check with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Calcium channel
blockers may worsen heart or blood vessel disorders.
The effects of calcium channel blockers may be
greater in people with kidney or liver disease, as their
bodies are slower to clear the drug from their systems.
Certain calcium channel blockers may also cause
problems in people with a history of heart rhythm prob-
lems or with depression, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, or other
types of parkinsonism.
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking calcium chan-
nel blockers with certain other drugs may affect the way
the drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.
As with most medications, certain side effects are
possible and some interactions with other substances
may occur.

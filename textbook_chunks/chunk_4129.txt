mia, all of which lead to decreased or defective produc-
tion of platelets in the bone marrow. Other diseases may
destroy platelets outside the marrow. These include
severe infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation,
and cirrhosis of the liver. The idiopathic form most com-
monly occurs in children, and is most likely the result of
production of antibodies that cause destruction of
platelets in the spleen and to a lesser extent the liver.
Von Willebrand’s disease is caused by a defect in the
Von Willebrand clotting factor, often accompanied by a
deficiency of Factor VIII as well. It is a hereditary disor-
der that affects both males and females. In rare cases, it
may be acquired. Symptoms include easy bruising, bleed-
ing in small cuts that stops and starts, abnormal bleeding
after surgery, and abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding.
Nosebleeds and blood in the stool with a black, tarlike
appearance are also signs of Von Willebrand’s disease.

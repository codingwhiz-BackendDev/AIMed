Cystinuria is a rare disease that occurs when people
inherit an abnormal gene from their parents. This disease
occurs in differing degrees of severity in people who
have inherited either one or two abnormal genes.
Humans have two copies of each gene. When both are
abnormal, the condition is called homozygous for the
disease. When one copy is normal and the other is abnor-
mal, the condition is called heterozygous for the disease.
Persons with one abnormal gene can have a milder form
of cystinuria that rarely results in the formation of stones.
Severe cystinuria occurs when people are homozy-
gous for the disease. For these individuals, the kidneys
may excrete as much as 30 times the normal amount of
cystine. Research has shown that this condition is caused
by mutations on chromosome number two (humans have
23 pairs of chromosomes).
A person who has inherited cystinuria may have
other abnormal bodily functions. In addition to excess
levels of the amino acid cystine, high amounts of the
amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine are found in
the urine. This condition indicates that these amino acids
are not being reabsorbed by the body.
When excess cystine crystals clump together to form
a stone, the stone can block portions of the interior of the
kidney or the tube (the ureter) that connects the kidney to
the urinary bladder. These cystine stones can be painful,
and depending upon where the stone becomes trapped,
the pain can be felt in the lower back or the abdomen.
Nausea and vomiting can also occur, and patients may
sometimes feel the need to urinate often. Cystine stones
can also cause blood in the urine. When the urinary tract
is blocked by a stone, urinary tract infections or kidney
failure may result.

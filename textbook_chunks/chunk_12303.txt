causing painful inflammation and fever. These
episodes may be accompanied by a skin rash or joint
pain. In a few cases, chronic arthritis is a problem.
Amyloidosis is a potentially serious condition in
which proteins called amyloids are mistakenly pro-
duced and deposited in organs and tissues throughout
the body. Left untreated, amyloidosis often leads to
kidney failure, which is the major long-term health
risk in FMF.
In most cases, the attacks of fever and pain are first
noticed in childhood or adolescence. The interval
between these episodes may be days or months, and is
not predictable. However, during these intervals people
with FMF typically lead normal lives. It is not entirely
clear what brings on an attack, but people with FMF
often report mild physical trauma, physical exertion, or
emotional stress just prior to the onset of symptoms.

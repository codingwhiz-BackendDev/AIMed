During a physical examination, a doctor might notice
that the liver is enlarged and tender when the abdomen is
palpated (examined with the tips of the fingers while the
patient lies flat). Blood tests may be used to determine if
the liver is functioning properly. A liver biopsy, where a
small sample of liver tissue is removed with a long needle
or though a very small incision, can be used to confirm
fatty liver. In pregnant women, the fatty liver condition is
usually associated with another serious complication, pre-
eclampsia or eclampsia. In this condition, the mother has
seriously high blood pressure, swelling, and possibly,
seizures. Laboratory abnormalities include elevations of
the SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase) and
SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase). In many
cases the alkaline phosphatase will be significantly elevat-
ed due to cholestasis produced by the fatty infiltration.

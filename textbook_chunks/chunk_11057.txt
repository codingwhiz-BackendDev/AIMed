Epidermolysis bullosa has three major forms and at
least 16 subtypes. The three major forms are EB simplex,
junctional EB, and dystrophic EB. These can range in
severity from mild blistering to more disfiguring and life-
threatening disease. Physicians diagnose the form of the
disease based on where the blister forms in relation to the
epidermis (the skinâ€™s outermost layer) and the deeper
dermis layer.
The prevalence of epidermolysis varies among dif-
ferent populations. A study in Scotland estimated the
prevalence to be one in 20,400. Researchers in other
parts of the world estimate the prevalence to be one in
100,000. This variance is due to the variability of expres-
sion. Many cases of epidermolysis bullosa are often not
accurately diagnosed and thus, are not reported.

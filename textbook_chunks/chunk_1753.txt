PAUL NIEHANS (1882–1971)
Paul Niehans was born and raised in Switzerland.
His father, a doctor, was dismayed when he entered the
seminary, but Niehans quickly grew dissatisfied with reli-
gious life and took up medicine after all. He first studied
at Bern, then completed an internship in Zurich.
Niehans enlisted in the Swiss Army in 1912. When
war erupted in the Balkans, Niehans set up a hospital in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The war provided him the opportu-
nity to treat numerous patients, gaining a firsthand knowl-
edge of the body and its workings.
Since 1913, Niehans had been intrigued with Alexis
Carrel’s experiments concerning the adaptive abilities of
cells, though Niehans himself specialized in glandular
transplants and by 1925 was one of the leading glandular
surgeons in Europe.
Niehans referred to 1931 as the birth year of cellular
therapy. That year, he treated a patient suffering from
tetany whose parathyroid had been erroneously removed
by another physician. Too weak for a glandular transplant,
the patient was given injections of the parathyroid glands
of an ox, and she soon recovered. Niehans made more
injections, even experimenting on himself, and reported
he could cure illnesses through injections of live cells
extracted from healthy animal organs. He believed
adding new tissue stimulated rejuvenation and recovery.
Niehans treated Pope Pious XII with his injections
and was nominated to the Vatican Academy of Science
following the pope’s recovery.
Niehans remained a controversial figure throughout
his life. As of 2000, the Clinique Paul Niehans in Switzer-
land, founded by his daughter, continues his work.

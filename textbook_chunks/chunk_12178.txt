After the surgery, a pressure bandage will be applied
to the face to reduce the risk of hematoma. The patient
may spend a few hours resting in a recovery room to
ensure no bleeding has occurred. The patient then returns
home. Some surgeons recommend that the patient remain
reclining for the next 24 hours, consuming a liquid diet,
and avoiding any movements that lead the neck to flex. Ice
packs for the first few days can help to reduce swelling
and lower the risk of hematoma. Patients continue taking
an antibiotic until the first stitches come out about five
days after the procedure. The balance are removed seven
to 10 days later. Many patients return to work and limited
activities within two weeks of the procedure.

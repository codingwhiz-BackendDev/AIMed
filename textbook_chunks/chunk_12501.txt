Fasts can be performed for varying lengths of time,
depending on the person and his or her health require-
ments. For chronic conditions, therapists recommend
from two to four weeks to get the most benefits. Seven-
day fasts are also commonly performed. A popular fast-
ing program for prevention and general health is a three-
day fast taken four times per year, at the change of each
season. These can be easily performed over long week-
ends. Preventative fasts of one day per week are used by
many people as well.
Juice fasts are also used by many people, although
these are not technically fasts. Juice fasts are less inten-
sive than water fasts because the body doesnâ€™t reach the
ketosis stage. The advantage of juice fasts is that fruit and
vegetable drinks can supply extra energy and nutrients.
People can fit a few days of juice fasting into their normal
schedules without significant drops in energy. Juice fasts
are also said to have cleansing and detoxifying effects.
The disadvantage of juice fasts is that the body never gets
to the ketosis stage, so these fasters are thought to lack the
deep detoxification and healing effects of the water fast.
Medical supervision is recommended for any fast
over three days. Most alternative medicine practitioners,
such as homeopaths, naturopathic doctors, and ayurvedic
doctors, can supervise and monitor patients during fasts.
Those performing extended fasts and those with health
conditions may require blood, urine, and other tests dur-
ing fasting. There are many alternative health clinics that
perform medically supervised fasts as well. Some con-
ventional medical doctors may also supervise patients
during fasts. Costs and insurance coverage vary, depend-
ing on the doctor, clinic, and requirements of the patient.

Patients who are vomiting or who have diarrhea
can prevent dehydration by drinking enough fluid for
their urine to remain the color of pale straw. Ensuring
that patients always drink adequate fluids during an ill-
ness will help prevent dehydration. Infants and young
children with diarrhea and vomiting can be given elec-
trolyte solutions such as Pedialyte to help prevent dehy-
dration. People who are not ill can maintain proper
fluid balance by drinking several glasses of water
before going outside on a hot day. It is also a good idea
to avoid coffee and tea, which increase body tempera-
ture and water loss.
Patients should know whether any medication they
are taking can cause dehydration and should get prompt
medical care to correct any underlying condition that
increases the risk of dehydration.
Other methods of preventing dehydration and ensur-
ing adequate fluid intake include:
• eating more soup at mealtime
• drinking plenty of water and juice at mealtime and
between meals
• keeping a glass of water nearby when working or relax-
ing

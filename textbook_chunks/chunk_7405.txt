Deep vein thrombosis can be treated with drug ther-
apy, bed rest, and gradient elastic stockings. Medications
include anticoagulants that “thin” blood to prevent fur-
ther growth of blood clots, as well as clot-dissolving
drugs. Heparin is a common injectable anticoagulant,
and is usually followed by coumadin tablets for at least
three months. Bed rest with the patient’s legs elevated is
necessary until the condition improves. Gradient elastic
stockings should then be worn, and standing for long
periods of time avoided. In some cases, a filter is placed
in the major vein (the inferior vena cava) to trap emboli
or clots before they get to the heart and lungs.

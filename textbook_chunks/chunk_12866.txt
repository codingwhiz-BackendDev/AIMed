For example, HBF can be found in higher levels in
hereditary hemolytic anemias, in all types of leukemias,
in pregnancy, diabetes, thyroid disease, and during anti-
convulsant drug therapy. It may also reappear in adults
when the bone marrow is overactive, as in the disorders
of pernicious anemia, multiple myeloma, and metastat-
ic cancer in the marrow. When HBF is increased after
age four, it should be investigated for cause.

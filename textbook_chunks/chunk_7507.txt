Mild dehydration rarely results in complications. If
the cause is eliminated and lost fluid is replaced, mild
dehydration can usually be cured in 24â€“48 hours.
Vomiting and diarrhea that continue for several days
without adequate fluid replacement can be fatal. The risk
of life-threatening complications is greater for young
children and the elderly. However, dehydration that is
rapidly recognized and treated has a good outcome.

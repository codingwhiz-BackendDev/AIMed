Fasts must be entered and exited with care. To enter
a fast, the diet should be gradually lightened over a few
days. First, heavy foods such as meats and dairy products
should be eliminated for a day or two. Grains, nuts, and
beans should then be reduced for several days. The day
before a fast, only easily digested foods like fruits, light
salads, and soups should be eaten. During the fast, only
pure water and occasional herbal teas should be drunk.
Fasts should be ended as gradually as they are
entered, going from lighter to heavier foods progressive-
ly. The diet after a fast should emphasize fresh, whole-
some foods. Fasters should particularly take care not to
overeat when they complete a fast.

In the final stage of labor, the placenta is pushed out
of the vagina by the continuing uterine contractions. The
placenta is pancake shaped and about 10 inches in diam-
eter. It has been attached to the wall of the uterus and has
served to convey nourishment from the mother to the
fetus throughout the pregnancy. Continuing uterine con-
tractions cause it to separate from the uterus at this point.
It is important that all of the placenta be removed from
the uterus. If it is not, the uterine bleeding that is normal
after delivery may be much heavier.

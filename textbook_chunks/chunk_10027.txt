Diagnosis is performed by a physician or other quali-
fied healthcare provider who will take a medical history,
discuss symptoms, perform a complete physical exami-
nation, and prescribe appropriate laboratory tests.
Because electrolyte disorders commonly affect the neuro-
muscular system, the provider will test reflexes. If a calci-
um imbalance is suspected, the physician will also check
for Chvostek’s sign, a reflex test that triggers an involun-
tary facial twitch, and Trousseau’s sign, a muscle spasm
that occurs in response to pressure on the upper arm.
Serum electrolyte imbalances can be detected
through blood tests. Blood is drawn from a vein on the
back of the hand or inside of the elbow by a medical
technician, or phlebotomist, and analyzed at a lab.

Women with recurrent UTIs can be given ultrasound
tests of the kidneys and bladder together with a voiding
cystourethrogram to test for structural abnormalities. (A
cystourethrogram is an x-ray test in which an iodine dye
is used to better view the urinary bladder and urethra.)
Voiding cystourethrograms are also used to evaluate chil-
dren with UTIs. In some cases, computed tomography
scans (CT scans) can be used to evaluate patients for
possible cancers in the urinary tract.

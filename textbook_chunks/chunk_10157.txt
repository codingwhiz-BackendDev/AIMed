The rhythmic pumping action of the heart, which is
essentially a muscle, is the result of electrical impulses
traveling throughout the walls of the four heart cham-
bers. These impulses originate in the sinoatrial (SA)
node, which are specialized cells situated in the top right
chamber of the heart: the right atrium. Normally, the SA
node, acting like a spark plug, spontaneously generates
the impulses, which travel through specific pathways
throughout the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node.
The AV node is a relay station, sending the impulses to
more specialized muscle fibers throughout the bottom
chambers of the heart: the ventricles. If these pathways
become damaged or blocked or if extra (abnormal) path-
ways exist, the heart’s rhythm may be altered (perhaps
too slow, too fast, or irregular), which can seriously
affect the heart’s pumping ability.
The patient is transported to the x-ray table in the EP
lab and connected to various monitors. Sterile sheets are
placed over him or her. A minimum of two catheters are
inserted into the right femoral (thigh) vein in the groin
area. Depending on the type of arrhythmia, the number
of catheters used in an EP test and their route to the heart
may vary. For certain tachycardias, two more catheters
may be inserted in the left groin and one in the internal
jugular (neck) vein or in the subclavian (below the clavi-

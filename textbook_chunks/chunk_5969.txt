Balloon angioplasty—The use of a balloon
attached to a catheter to widen an artery that has
become narrowed. As the balloon is inflated, it
opens the artery.
Cardiac angiography—A procedure used to visu-
alize blood vessels of the heart. A catheter is used
to inject a dye into the vessels; the vessels can
then be seen by x ray.
Catheter—A long thin flexible tube that can be
inserted into the body; in this case, it is threaded
to the heart.
Restenosis—The narrowing of a blood vessel after
it has been opened, usually by balloon angioplasty.
Thrombosis—The development of a blood clot in
the vessels. This thrombosis may clog a blood ves-
sel and stop the flow of blood.

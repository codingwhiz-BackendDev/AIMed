Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is also known
as congophilic angiopathy or cerebrovascular amyloido-
sis. It is a disease of small blood vessels in the brain in
which deposits of amyloid protein in the vessel walls
may lead to stroke, brain hemorrhage, or dementia.
Amyloid protein resembles a starch and is deposited in
tissues during the course of certain chronic diseases.

Children will sometimes put things into their noses,
ears, and other openings. Beans, popcorn kernels, raisins,
and beads are just a few of the many items that have been
found in these bodily cavities. On occasion, insects may
also fly into the ears and nose. Pain, hearing loss, and a
sense of something stuck in the ear are symptoms of for-
eign bodies in the ears. A smelly, bloody discharge from
one nostril is a symptom of foreign bodies in the nose.

out but may be longer in adolescents and adults. For this
reason, doctors recommend keeping children with chick-
enpox away from school for about a week. It is not nec-
essary, however, to wait until all the scabs have fallen off.
Chickenpox has been a typical part of growing up for
most children in the industrialized world (although this
may change if the new varicella vaccine becomes more
widely accepted). The disease can strike at any age, but
by ages nine or 10 about 80â€“90% of American children
have already been infected. U.S. children living in rural
areas and many foreign-born children are less likely to be
immune. Because almost every case of chickenpox, no
matter how mild, leads to lifelong protection against fur-
ther attacks, adults account for less than 5% of all cases in
the United States. Study results reported by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that
more than 90% of American adults are immune to the
chickenpox virus. Adults, however, are much more likely
than children to suffer dangerous complications. More
than half of all chickenpox deaths occur among adults.

The outlook for children with congenital heart dis-
ease has improved markedly in the past two decades.
Many types of congenital heart disease that would have
been fatal can now be treated successfully. Research on
diagnosing heart defects when the fetus is in the womb
may lead to future treatment to correct defects before
birth. Promising new prevention methods and treatments
include genetic screening and the cultivation of cardiac
tissue in the laboratory that could be used to repair con-
genital heart defects.

ERS is generally performed only after ERCP has
been successfully accomplished and detail of the anato-
my and abnormalities is known. During ERS, a number
of various instruments are inserted through the endo-
scope in order to “cut” or stretch the sphincter. Once this
is done, additional instruments are passed that enable the
removal of stones and the stretching of narrowed regions
of the ducts. Drains (stents) can also be used to prevent a
narrowed area from rapidly returning to its previously
narrowed state.

Occasionally, there may be an underlying physical
condition that inhibits the babyâ€™s ability to take in, digest,
or process food. These defects can occur in the esopha-
gus, stomach, small or large intestine, rectum or anus.
Usually the defect is an incomplete development of the
organ, and it must be surgically corrected. Most physical
defects can be detected shortly after birth.

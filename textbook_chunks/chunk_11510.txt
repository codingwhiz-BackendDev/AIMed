Stage 0 is the earliest stage of the disease. Cancer
cells are confined to the innermost lining of the esopha-
gus. Stage I esophageal cancer has spread slightly deep-
er, but still has not extended to nearby tissues, lymph
nodes, or other organs. In Stage IIA, cancer has invaded
the thick, muscular layer of the esophagus that propels
food into the stomach and may involve connective tissue
covering the outside of the esophagus. In Stage IIB, can-
cer has spread to lymph nodes near the esophagus and
may have invaded deeper layers of esophageal tissue.
Stage III esophageal cancer has spread to tissues or
lymph nodes near the esophagus or to the trachea (wind-
pipe) or other organs near the esophagus. Stage IV can-
cer has spread to distant organs like the liver, bones, and
brain. Recurrent esophageal cancer is disease that devel-
ops in the esophagus or another part of the body after ini-
tial treatment.

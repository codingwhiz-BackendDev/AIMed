Treatment of DLE primarily involves the use of a
variety of skin creams. Sunscreens are used for protec-
tion. Steroid creams can be applied to decrease inflamma-
tion. Occasionally, small amounts of a steroid preparation
will be injected with a needle into a specific lesion.
Because of their long list of side effects, steroid prepara-
tions taken by mouth are avoided. Sometimes, short-term
treatment with oral steroids will be used for particularly
severe DLE outbreaks. Medications used to treat the
infectious disease malaria are often used to treat DLE.

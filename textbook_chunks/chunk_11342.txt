ESR is increased in rheumatoid diseases, most infec-
tions, and in cancer. An advanced rate doesn’t diagnose
a specific disease, but it does indicate that an underlying
disease may be present.
A physician can use ESR to monitor a person with an
associated disease. When the disease worsens, the ESR
increases; when the disease improves, the ESR decreases.
The ESR doesn’t always follow the course of cancer.
ESR is called an acute-phase reactant test, meaning
that it reacts to acute conditions in the body, such as
infection or trauma. The rate increase follows a rise in
temperature and white blood cells count, peaks after sev-
eral days, and usually lasts longer than the elevated tem-
perature or white blood cells count.

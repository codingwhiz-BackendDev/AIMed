The cornea is the transparent layer of tissue at the
very front of the eye. It is composed almost entirely of a
special type of collagen. It normally contains no blood
vessels, but because it contains nerve endings, damage to
the cornea can be very painful.
In a corneal transplant, a disc of tissue is removed
from the center of the eye and replaced by a correspond-
ing disc from a donor eye. The circular incision is made
using an instrument called a trephine. In one form of
corneal transplant (penetrating keratoplasty), the disc
removed is the entire thickness of the cornea and so is the
replacement disc. Over 90% of all corneal transplants in
the United States are of this type. In lamellar keratoplas-
ty, on the other hand, only the outer layer of the cornea is
removed and replaced.
The donor cornea is attached with extremely fine
sutures. Surgery can be performed under anesthesia that is
confined to one area of the body while the patient is
awake (local anesthesia) or under anesthesia that places
the entire body of the patient in a state of unconsciousness
(general anesthesia.) Surgery requires 30â€“90 minutes.
Over 40,000 corneal transplants are performed in the
United States each year. Medicare reimbursement for a
corneal transplant in one eye was about $1,200 in 1997.
A less common but related procedure called epiker-
atophakia involves suturing the donor cornea directly

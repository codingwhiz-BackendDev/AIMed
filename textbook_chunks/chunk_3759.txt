• Edema. Puffiness or swelling around the eyes, arms,
hands, and feet.
• Frequent urination.
• Foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause
it to foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicate
bleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,
or ureters.
• Headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.
• Hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of
fluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase,
which in turn, causes blood pressure to rise.
• Increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and the
presence of anemia may cause feelings of exhaustion.
• Itching. Phosphorus, which is typically eliminated in
the urine, accumulates in the blood of patients with kid-
ney failure. This heightened phosphorus level may
cause itching of the skin.
• Lower back pain. Pain where the kidneys are located, in
the small of the back below the ribs.
• Nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Urea in the gas-
tric juices may cause upset stomach. This can lead to
malnutrition and weight loss.

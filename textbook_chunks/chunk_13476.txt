mals as well as humans. Their life cycle is similar to that
of liver flukes except that their encysted larvae infect crabs
and crayfish rather than plants or fish. Humans can ingest

water or eating raw or undercooked crabs and crayfish.
In humans, the metacercariae are released from their
cysts in the small intestine and migrate to the lungs or the
brain in 1% of cases. In the lungs, the flukes lay their
eggs and form areas of inflammation covered with a thin
layer of fibrous tissue. These areas of infection may
eventually rupture, causing the patient to cough up fluke
eggs, blood, and inflamed tissue. The period between the

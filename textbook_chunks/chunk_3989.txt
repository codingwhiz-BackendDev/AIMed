Clenched fist injuries are most common over the
metacarpo phalangeal joint. Their appearance is deceptive
because they do not bleed heavily and the underlying injury
is hidden by soft tissue when the patient opens his hand and
straightens the injured finger. CFIs can, however, have seri-
ous consequences, including infection, cellulitis, inflam-
mation of the bone or bone marrow (osteomyelitis), septic
arthritis, and inflammation of the sheaths covering the ten-
dons of the hand (tenosynovitis). These may lead to perma-
nent loss of function or amputation.
Most CFIs result in tissue injury due to the force of
impact, ragged-edged tears in the skin resulting from
contact with the teeth, and contamination of the wound
by the bacteria in human saliva. As the patient opens his
hand, the skin of the finger is pulled backward over the
deeper part of the wound, thus sealing bacteria within the
injured tissue. This sealing of the wound by normal
motions of the finger is the reason why clenched fist
injuries have the highest rate of infection of any human
bite. The rate of infection of clenched-fist injuries varies
from 15â€“50%.

Fasting can be used for nearly every chronic condi-
tion, including allergies, anxiety, arthritis, asthma,
depression, diabetes, headaches, heart disease, high cho-
lesterol, low blood sugar, digestive disorders, mental ill-
ness, and obesity. Fasting is an effective and safe weight
loss method. It is frequently prescribed as a detoxifica-
tion treatment for those with conditions that may be
influenced by environmental factors, such as cancer and
multiple chemical sensitivity. Fasting has been used
successfully to help treat people who have been exposed
to high levels of toxic materials due to accident or occu-
pation. Fasting is thought to be beneficial as a preventa-
tive measure to increase overall health, vitality, and resis-
tance to disease. Fasting is also used as a method of men-
tal and spiritual rejuvenation.

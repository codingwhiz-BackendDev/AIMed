The prognosis for childhood health problems varies
widely. In general, early detection and proper treatment
can greatly improve the odds of recovery from many
childhood ailments.
Some learning disabilities and mild developmental
disorders can be overcome or greatly improved through
the therapies discussed above. However, as of early 2001,
there was no known medical treatment or pharmacologi-
cal therapy that is capable of completely eliminating all
of the symptoms associated with pervasive developmen-
tal disorder (PDD), autism spectrum disorder, and mental
retardation. Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder are also chronic, lifelong disorders,
although their symptoms can often be well-controlled
with medication.

Choice of treatment for encephalitis will depend on
the cause. Bacterial encephalitis is treated with antibi-
otics. Viral encephalitis is usually treated with antiviral
drugs including acyclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, ribo-
varin, and AZT. Viruses that respond to acyclovir include
herpes simplex, the most common cause of sporadic
(non-epidemic) encephalitis in the United States.
The symptoms of encephalitis may be treated with a
number of different drugs. Corticosteroids, including
prednisone and dexamethasone, are sometimes pre-
scribed to reduce inflammation and brain swelling. Anti-
convulsant drugs, including dilantin and phenytoin, are
used to control seizures. Fever may be reduced with
acetaminophen or other fever-reducing drugs.
A person with encephalitis must be monitored care-
fully, since symptoms may change rapidly. Blood tests
may be required regularly to track levels of fluids and
salts in the blood.

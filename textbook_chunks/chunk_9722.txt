Under the old classification system, EDS classical
type was divided into two separate types: type I and type
II. The major symptoms involved in EDS classical type
are the skin and joints. The skin has a smooth, velvety
texture and bruises easily. Affected individuals typically
have extensive scaring, particularly at the knees, elbows,
forehead, and chin. The joints are hyperextensible, giving
a tendency towards dislocation of the hip, shoulder,
elbow, knee, or clavicle. Due to decreased muscle tone,
affected infants may experience a delay in reaching motor
milestones. Children may have a tendency to develop her-
nias or other organ shifts within the abdomen. Sprains and
partial or complete joint dilocations are also common.

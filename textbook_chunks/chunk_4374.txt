The cold agglutinins test is performed to detect the
presence of antibodies in blood that are sensitive to tem-
perature changes. Antibodies are proteins produced by
the immune system in response to specific disease
agents; autoantibodies are antibodies that the body pro-
duces against one of its own substances. Cold agglutinins
are autoantibodies that cause red blood cells to clump,
but only when the blood is cooled below the normal body
temperature of 98.6째F (37째C). The clumping is most pro-
nounced at temperatures below 78째F (25.6째C).

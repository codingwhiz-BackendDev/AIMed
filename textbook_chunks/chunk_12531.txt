Fatigue may be the result of one or more environ-
mental causes such as inadequate rest, improper diet,
work and home stressors, or poor physical conditioning,
or one symptom of a chronic medical condition or dis-
ease process in the body. Heart disease, low blood pres-
sure, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, iron-deficiency
anemia, narcolepsy, and cancer can cause long-term,
ongoing fatigue symptoms. Acute illnesses such as viral
and bacterial infections can also trigger temporary feel-
ings of exhaustion. In addition, mental disorders such as
depression can also cause fatigue.
A number of medications, including antihistamines,
antibiotics, and blood pressure medications, may cause
drowsiness as a side-effect. Individuals already suffering
from fatigue who are prescribed one of these medications
may wish to check with their healthcare provider about
alternative treatments.
Extreme fatigue which persists, unabated, for at least
six months, is not the result of a diagnosed disease or ill-
ness, and is characterized by flu-like symptoms such as
swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, and muscle weakness
and/or pain may indicate a diagnosis of chronic fatigue
syndrome. Chronic fatigue syndrome (sometimes called
chronic fatigue immune deficiency syndrome), is a debil-
itating illness that causes overwhelming exhaustion and a
constellation of neurological and immunological symp-
toms. Between 1.5 and 2 million Americans are estimat-
ed to suffer from the disorder.

A simple hysterectomy is used to treat some stages
0 and IA cervical cancers. Usually only the uterus is
removed, although occasionally the fallopian tubes and
ovaries are removed as well. The tissues adjoining the
uterus, including the vagina, remain intact. The uterus
may be removed either through the abdomen or the
vagina.
In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus and adjoining
tissues, including the ovaries, the upper region (1 in) of
the vagina near the cervix, and the pelvic lymph nodes,
are all removed. A radical hysterectomy usually involves
abdominal surgery. However, it can be performed vagi-
nally, in combination with a laparoscopic pelvic lymph
node dissection. With laparoscopy, a tube is inserted
through a very small surgical incision for the removal of
the lymph nodes. These operations are used to treat
stages IA2, IB, and IIA cervical cancers, particularly in
young women. Following a hysterectomy, the tissue is
examined to see if the cancer has spread and requires
additional radiation treatment. Women who have had
hysterectomies cannot become pregnant, but complica-
tions from a hysterectomy are rare.
If cervical cancer recurs following treatment, a
pelvic exenteration (extensive surgery) may be per-
formed. This includes a radical hysterectomy, with the
additional removal of the bladder, rectum, part of the
colon, and/or all of the vagina. Such operations require
the creation of new openings for the urine and feces. A
new vagina may be created surgically. Often the clitoris
and other outer genitals are left intact.
Recovery from a pelvic exenteration may take six
months to two years. This treatment is successful with
40â€“50% of recurrent cervical cancers that are confined to
the pelvis. If the recurrent cancer has spread to other
organs, radiation or chemotherapy may be used to alle-
viate some of the symptoms.

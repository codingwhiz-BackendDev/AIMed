Blood tests may be useful in diagnosing fluke
infections, but their usefulness is limited because of
cross-reactions. A cross-reaction occurs in blood testing
when a particular disease agent reacts with antibodies
specific to another disease agent. This result means that
the doctor may know that the person is infected by
flukes but cannot tell from the blood test alone which
specific type of fluke is causing the disease. In addition,
blood tests for fluke infections cannot distinguish
between past and current infections. In some cases,
sophisticated imaging techniques, such as computed
tomography scans (CT scans) or ultrasound scans of
the patientâ€™s chest or brain (for lung flukes) or abdomen
(for liver flukes), are useful in confirming a diagnosis
of fluke infection.

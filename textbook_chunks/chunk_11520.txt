In addition to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation,
other palliative measures can provide symptomatic relief.
Dilatation of the narrowed portion of the esophagus with
soft tubes can provide short-term relief of dysphagia. Place-

portion is also useful in allowing more food intake.
Follow-up treatments
Regular barium swallows and other imaging studies
are necessary to detect recurrence or spread of disease or
new tumor development.

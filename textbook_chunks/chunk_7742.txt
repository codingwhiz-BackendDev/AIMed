Norplant is a long-acting hormone that is inserted
under the skin and prevents conception for up to five
years. Depo-Provera is also a hormone, but is administered
by intramuscular injection and provides protection against
pregnancy for three months. Lunelle is another injectable
contraceptive that is administered monthly (every 28 to 30
days); it was approved by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) in October 2000. The hormone in Norplant and
Depo-Provera is progestin, a synthetic hormone similar to
one found naturally in a womanâ€™s body; Lunelle contains
the hormones progestin and estrogen.

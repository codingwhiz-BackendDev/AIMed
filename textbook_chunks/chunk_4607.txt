Color blindness is an abnormal condition character-
ized by the inability to clearly distinguish different colors
of the spectrum. The difficulties can be mild to severe. It
is a misleading term because people with color blindness
are not blind. Rather, they tend to see colors in a limited
range of hues; a rare few may not see colors at all.

• Liver involvement causes pain and eventually jaundice
or cholangitis due to blockage of bile ducts. Infection
of cysts leads to abscesses in up to 20%.
• Lung cysts cause cough and chest pain.
• Bone cysts cause fractures and damage to bone tissue.
• Heart involvement leads to irregularities of heart beat
and inflammation of the covering of the heart (peri-
cardium).
• Allergic reactions occur from leakage of cyst fluid that
contains antigens. Itching, fever, and rashes are fre-
quent, and fatal allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) have
been reported. Eosinophils, which are blood cells
involved in allergic reactions, are increased in many
patients.

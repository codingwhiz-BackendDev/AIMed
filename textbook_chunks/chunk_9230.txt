Menorrhagia, sometimes called hypermenorrhea, is
another term for abnormally long, heavy periods. This
type of period can be a symptom of DUB, or many other
diseases or disorders. In menorrhagia, menstrual periods
occur regularly, but last more than seven days, and blood
loss exceeds 3 oz (88.7 ml). Passing blood clots is com-
mon. Between 15â€“20% of healthy women experience
debilitating menorrhagia that interferes with their normal
activities. Menorrhagia may or may not signify a serious
underlying problem.

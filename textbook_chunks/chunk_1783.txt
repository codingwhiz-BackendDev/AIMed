Most CNS depressants have the potential to be physi-
cally and psychologically addictive. Alcohol is the most
widely abused depressant. The body tends to develop tol-
erance for CNS depressants, and larger doses are needed
to achieve the same effects. Withdrawal from some CNS
depressants can be uncomfortable; for example, with-
drawal from a depressant treating insomnia or anxiety can
cause rebound insomnia or anxiety as the brain’s activity
bounces back after being suppressed. In some cases with-
drawal can result in life-threatening seizures. Generally,
depressant withdrawal should be undertaken under a
physician’s supervision. Many physicians will reduce the
depressant dosage gradually, to give the body time to
adjust. Certain CNS depressants such as barbiturates are
easy to overdose on, since there is a relatively small dif-
ference between the optimal dose and an overdose. A
small miscalculation can lead to coma, slowed breathing,
and death. CNS depressants should be administered to
elderly individuals with care, as these individuals have a
reduced ability to metabolize CNS depressants.

Immobilization of a fracture site can be done inter-
nally or externally. The primary goal of immobilization
is to maintain the realignment of a bone long enough for
healing to start and progress. Immobilization by external
fixation uses splints, casts, or braces. This may be the
primary and only procedure for fracture treatment.
Splinting to immobilize a fracture can be done with or
without traction. In emergency situations if the injured
individual must be moved by someone other than a
trained medical person, splinting is a useful form of frac-
ture management. It should be done without causing
additional pain and without moving the bone segments.
In a clinical environment, plaster of Paris casts are used
for immobilization. Braces are useful as they often allow
movement above and below a fracture site. Treatments
for stress fractures include rest and decreasing or stop-
ping any activity that causes or increases pain.

Postural drainage uses the force of gravity to assist
in effectively draining secretions from the lungs and into
the central airway where they can either be coughed up
or suctioned out. The patient is placed in a head or chest
down position and is kept in this position for up to 15
minutes. Critical care patients and those depending on
mechanical ventilation receive postural drainage therapy
four to six times daily. Percussion and vibration may be
performed in conjunction with postural drainage.

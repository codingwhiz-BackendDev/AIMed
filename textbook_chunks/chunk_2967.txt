If the labor is not progressing as it should or if the
baby appears to be in distress, the doctor may opt for a
forceps delivery. A forceps is a spoon-shaped device that
resembles a set of salad tongs. It is placed around the
baby’s head so the doctor can pull the baby gently out of
the vagina.
Forceps can be used after the cervix is fully dilated,
and they might be required if:
• the umbilical cord has dropped down in front of the
baby into the birth canal
• the baby is too large to pass through the birth canal
unaided
• the baby shows signs of stress
• the mother is too exhausted to push
Before placing the forceps around the baby’s head,
pain medication or anesthesia may be given to the moth-
er. The doctor may use a catheter to empty the mother’s
bladder, and may clean the perineal area with soapy
water. Often an episiotomy is done before a forceps birth,
although tears can still occur.
The obstetrician slides half of the forceps at a time
into the vagina and around the side of the baby’s head to
gently grasp the head. When both “tongs” are in place, the
doctor pulls on the forceps to help the baby through the
birth canal as the uterus contracts. Sometimes the baby
can be delivered this way after the very next contraction.
The frequency of forceps delivery varies from one
hospital to the next, depending on the experience of staff
and the types of anesthesia offered at the hospital. Some
obstetricians accept the need for a forceps delivery as a
way to avoid cesarean birth. However, other obstetrical
services don’t use forceps at all.
Complications from forceps deliveries can occur.
Sometimes they may cause nerve damage or temporary

Electrocardiography is a starting point for detecting
many cardiac problems. It is used routinely in physical
examinations and for monitoring the patientâ€™s condition
during and after surgery, as well as during intensive care.
It is the basic measurement used for tests such as exercise
tolerance. It is used to evaluate causes of symptoms such
as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations.

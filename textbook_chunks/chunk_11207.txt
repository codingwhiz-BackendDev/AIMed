The pattern of the three antibodies can be used to
determine whether the person has not had infection with
EBV to this point (is susceptible to infection); is current-
ly, or recently, infected with EBV for the first time; or
has had first time infection with EBV sometime in the
past (more than six months ago).
If one defines “normal” results as either not having
EBV in the past, and call that category one; or having
had it in the past, and call that category two. Most young
children below the age of five will fall into category one,
while most adults over the age of 20 years will fall into
category two.

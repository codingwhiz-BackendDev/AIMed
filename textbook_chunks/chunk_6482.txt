Cryotherapy can be employed to destroy a variety of
benign skin growths, such as warts, pre-cancerous lesions
(such as actinic keratoses), and malignant lesions (such as
basal cell and squamous cell cancers). The goal of
cryotherapy is to freeze and destroy targeted skin growths
while preserving the surrounding skin from injury.

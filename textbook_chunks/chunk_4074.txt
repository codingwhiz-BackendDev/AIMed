Treatment for cluster headaches is composed of
induction, maintenance, and symptomatic therapies. The
first two therapies are prophylactic treatments, geared
toward preventing headaches. Symptomatic therapy is

Induction therapy is intended to break the headache cycle
with drugs such as corticosteroids (for example, pred-

Despite prophylactic treatment, headaches may still
occur. Symptomatic therapy includes oxygen inhalation,

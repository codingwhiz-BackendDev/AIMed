Computed tomography (CT) is a process that images
anatomic information from a cross-sectional plane of the
body. Biopsy is the process of taking a sample of tissue
from the body for analysis. CT is commonly used in
biopsies to provide images that help guide the tools or
equipment necessary to perform the biopsy to the appro-
priate area of the body.

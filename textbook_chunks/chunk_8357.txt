The major effects of diarrhea are dehydration, mal-
nutrition, and weight loss. Signs of dehydration can be
hard to notice, but increasing thirst, dry mouth, weak-
ness or lightheadedness (particularly if worsening on
standing), or a darkening/decrease in urination are sug-
gestive. Severe dehydration leads to changes in the
bodyâ€™s chemistry and could become life-threatening.
Dehydration from diarrhea can result in kidney failure,
neurological symptoms, arthritis, and skin problems.

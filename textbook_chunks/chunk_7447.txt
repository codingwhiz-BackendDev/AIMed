After defibrillation, the patient’s cardiac status, breath-
ing, and vital signs are monitored until he or she is stable.
Typically, this monitoring takes place after the patient has
been removed to an intensive care or cardiac care unit in a
hospital. An electrocardiogram and chest x ray are taken.
The patient’s skin is cleansed to remove gel or paste, and, if
necessary, ointment is applied to burns. An intravenous
line provides additional medication, as needed.

External beam or internal radiation, delivered by
machine or implanted near cancer cells inside the body,
is only rarely used as the primary form of treatment.
Post-operative radiation is sometimes used to kill cancer
cells that couldnâ€™t be surgically removed. Palliative radi-
ation is effective in relieving dysphagia in patients who
cannot be cured. However, radiation is most useful when
combined with chemotherapy as either the definitive
treatment or preoperative treatment.

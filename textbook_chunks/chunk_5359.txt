exposed to microorganisms and environmental agents
that can cause infections or allergic reactions. Conjunc-
tivitis can be acute or chronic depending upon how long
the condition lasts, the severity of symptoms, and the
type of organism or agent involved. It can also affect one
or both eyes and, if caused by infection, can be very easi-
ly transmitted to others during close physical contact,
particularly among children in a daycare center. Other
names for conjunctivitis include pink eye and red eye.

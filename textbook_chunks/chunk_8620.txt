Diagnosis of DLE usually requires a skin biopsy. A
small sample of a discoid lesion is removed, specially
prepared, and examined under a microscope. Usually, the
lesion has certain microscopic characteristics that allow it
to be identified as a DLE lesion. Blood tests will not
reveal the type of antibodies present in SLE, and physical
examination usually does not reveal anything other than
the skin lesions. If antibodies exist in the blood, or if other
symptoms or physical signs are found, it is possible that
the discoid lesions are a sign of SLE rather than DLE.

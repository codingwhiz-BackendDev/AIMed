If changes in diet and activity fail to relieve occa-
sional constipation, an over-the-counter laxative may be
used for a few days. Preparations that soften stools or add
bulk (bran, psyllium) work more slowly but are safer
than Epsom salts and other harsh laxatives or herbal lax-
atives containing senna (Cassia senna) or buckthorn
(Rhamnus purshianna), which can harm the nerves and
lining of the colon.
A woman who is pregnant should never use a laxa-
tive. Neither should anyone who is experiencing abdomi-
nal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
A warm-water or mineral oil enema can relieve con-
stipation, and a non-digestible sugar (lactulose) or spe-
cial electrolyte solution is recommended for adults and
older children with stubborn symptoms.
If a patient has an impacted bowel, the doctor inserts
a gloved finger into the rectum and gently dislodges the
hardened feces.

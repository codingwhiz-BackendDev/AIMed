of cirrhosis are usually caused by the loss
of functioning liver cells or organ swelling due to scarring.
The liver enlarges during the early stages of illness. The
palms of the hands turn red and patients may experience:
• constipation
• diarrhea
• dull abdominal pain
• fatigue
• indigestion
• loss of appetite
• nausea
• vomiting
• weakness
• weight loss
As the disease progresses, the spleen enlarges and
fluid collects in the abdomen (ascites) and legs (edema).
Spider-like blood vessels appear on the chest and shoul-
ders, and bruising becomes common. Men sometimes
lose chest hair. Their breasts may grow and their testicles
may shrink. Women may have menstrual irregularities.
Cirrhosis can cause extremely dry skin and intense
itching. The whites of the eyes and the skin may turn
yellow (jaundice), and urine may be dark yellow or
brown. Stools may be black or bloody. Sometimes the
patient develops persistent high blood pressure due to the
scarring (portal hypertension). This type of hyperten-
sion can be life threatening. It can cause veins to enlarge
in the stomach and in the tube leading from the mouth to
the stomach (esophagus). These enlarged veins are called
varices, and they can rupture and bleed massively.

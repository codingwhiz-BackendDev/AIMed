A condom is most effective when it is placed on the penis correctly without trapping air between the penis and the condom.

been slight.
Male condoms may be purchased lubricated, ribbed,
or treated with spermicide (a chemical that kills sperm).
To be effective, condoms must be removed carefully so
as not to “spill” the contents into the vaginal canal. Con-
doms that leak or break do not provide protection against
pregnancy or disease.
If used correctly, male condoms have an effective-
ness rate of about 90% for preventing pregnancy, but
this rate can be increased to about 99% if used with a
spermicide. (Several types of spermicides are available;
they can be purchased in the form of contraceptive
creams and jellies, foams, or films.) Benefits associated
with this type of contraceptive device include easy avail-
ability (no prescription is required), convenience of use,
and lack of serious side effects. The primary disadvan-
tage is that sexual activity must be interrupted in order
to put the condom on.
Female condoms, when used correctly and at every
instance of intercourse, were shown to prevent pregnancy
in over 95% of women surveyed over the course of six
months. When used inconsistently, the female condom
was shown to have a failure rate of 21% in the same
study. One benefit of the female condom is that it may be
inserted immediately before sexual intercourse or up to
eight hours prior, so that sexual activity does not need to
be interrupted for its insertion. One study performed by a
manufacturer of the female condom indicated that
50–75% of couples in numerous countries found the bar-
rier acceptable for use.
Condoms provide better protection against STDs
than any other contraceptive method. One study conduct-
ed in the 1990s indicated that out of 123 couples with
one HIV-positive partner, not one healthy individual con-

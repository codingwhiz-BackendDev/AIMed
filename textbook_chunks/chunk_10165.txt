An electrophysiologist nurse monitors a patient’s heart rhythm during an electrophysiology study for tachycardia. (Photo-

• the patient may be advised to stop taking certain med-
ications, especially heart drugs, that may interfere with
the test results.
• blood tests usually are ordered the week before the test.
• the patient undergoes conscious sedation (awake but
relaxed) during the test. This is accomplished quite
often with the anesthetic drugs VersedR (Roche labora-
tories) and fentanyl.
• a local anesthetic is injected at the site of catheter inser-
tion.

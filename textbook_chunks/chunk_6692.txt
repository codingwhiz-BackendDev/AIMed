Cutaneous larvae migrans (also called “creeping
eruption” or “ground itch”) is found in southeastern and
Gulf states, and in tropical developing countries.
The hookworms that cause the condition are small,
round blood-sucking worms that infest about 700 million
people around the world. Cutaneous larvae migrans
occurs most often among children, those who crawl
beneath raised buildings, and sunbathers who lie down
on wet sand contaminated with hookworm larvae.

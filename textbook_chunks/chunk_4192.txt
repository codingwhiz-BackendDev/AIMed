Cocaine is one of the oldest known psychoactive
drugs. Coca leaves, the source of cocaine, were used by
the Incas and other inhabitants of the Andean region of
South America for thousands of years, both as a stimu-
lant and to depress appetite and combat apoxia (altitude
sickness).
Despite the long history of coca leaf use, it was not
until the latter part of the nineteenth century that the
active ingredient of the plant, cocaine hydrochloride, was
first extracted from those leaves. The new drug soon
became a common ingredient in patent medicines and
other popular products (including the original formula
for Coca-Cola). This widespread use quickly raised con-
cerns about the drugâ€™s negative effects. In the early
1900s, several legislative steps were taken to address
those concerns; the Harrison Act of 1914 banned the use
of cocaine and other substances in non-prescription prod-
ucts. In the wake of those actions, cocaine use declined
substantially.
The drug culture of the 1960s sparked renewed
interest in cocaine. With the advent of crack in the 1980s,
use of the drug had once again become a national prob-
lem. Cocaine use declined significantly during the early
1990s, but it remains a significant problem and is on the
increase in certain geographic areas and among certain
age groups.

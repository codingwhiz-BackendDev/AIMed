meningitis, such as stiff neck and aversion to light, do not
occur in many patients, diagnosis is often delayed. In
addition to meningitis, inflammation of the brain
(encephalitis) and brain lesions called cryptococcomas
or tortulomas can also develop.
In addition to the brain, the cryptococcal infection
can spread to the kidneys, bone marrow, heart, adrenal
glands, lymph nodes, urinary tract, blood, and skin.
Often times preceding the development of cryptococcal
meningitis, painless rashes and lesions that mimic other
skin diseases, such as molluscum contagiosum, may
develop. A small percentage of patients with brain infec-
tions show infections in other organs as well.

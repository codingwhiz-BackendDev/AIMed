The prognosis for styes and chalazia is good to
excellent. With treatment, blepharitis, ectropion, and
entropion usually have good outcomes. The prognosis
for nonmalignant tumors, basal cell carcinoma, and squa-
mous cell carcinoma is good once they are properly
removed. Survival rate for malignant melanoma depends
upon how early it was discovered and if it was complete-
ly removed. Sebaceous carcinomas are difficult to detect,
so poor outcomes are more frequent.

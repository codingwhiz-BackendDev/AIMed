Diverticula tend to occur most frequently in the
last segment of the large intestine, the sigmoid colon.
They occur with decreasing frequency as one examines
further back toward the beginning of the large intes-
tine. The chance of developing diverticula increases
with age, so that by the age of 50, about 20â€“50% of all
people will have some diverticula. By the age of 90,
virtually everyone will have developed some diverticu-
la. Most diverticula measure about 3 mm to just over 3
cm in diameter. Larger diverticula, termed giant diver-
ticula, are quite infrequent, but may measure as large
as 15 cm in diameter.

The treatment for this illness is general. Patients are
given fluids (by mouth or through a vein) and medica-
tions to decrease the itching or to treat vomiting and/or
diarrhea. The neurological symptoms can cause discom-
fort and treatment with amitriptyline (a medicine that has
been used for depression) may be useful. Other medica-
tions may also be given.

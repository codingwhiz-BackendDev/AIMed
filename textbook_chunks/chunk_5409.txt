Everyone becomes constipated once in a while, but a
doctor should be notified if significant changes in bowel
patterns last for more than a week or if symptoms contin-
ue more than three weeks after increasing activity and
fiber and fluid intake.
The patientâ€™s observations and medical history help
a primary care physician diagnose constipation. The doc-
tor uses his fingers to see if there is a hardened mass in
the abdomen, and may perform a rectal examination.
Other diagnostic procedures include a barium enema,
which reveals blockage inside the intestine; laboratory
analysis of blood and stool samples for internal bleeding
or other symptoms of systemic disease; and a sigmoi-
doscopy (examination of the sigmoid area of the colon
with a flexible tube equipped with a magnifying lens).
Physical and psychological assessments and a
detailed history of bowel habits are especially important
when an elderly person complains of constipation.

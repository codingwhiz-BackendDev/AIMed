Chondromalacia patellae (CMP), also known as
patello-femoral pain syndrome or patello-femoral stress
syndrome, is a syndrome that causes pain/discomfort at
the front of the knee. It is associated with irritation or
wear on the underside of the kneecap, or patella. In a nor-
mal knee, the articular cartilage is smooth and elastic and
glides smoothly over the surface of the thighbone, or
femur when the knee is bent. Erosion of the cartilage
roughens the surface and prevents this smooth action.
CMP is most common in adolescent females,
although older people may also develop it. An average of
two out of 10,000 people develop this condition, many of
them runners or other athletes.

Delusions are a common symptom of several mood
and personality-related mental illnesses, including
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, shared psy-
chotic disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar
disorder. They are also the major feature of delusional
disorder. Individuals with delusional disorder suffer
from long-term, complex delusions that fall into one of
six categories: persecutory, grandiose, jealousy, ero-
tomanic, somatic, or mixed. There are also delusional
disorders such as dementia that clearly have organic or
physical causes.

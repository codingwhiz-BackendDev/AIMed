Family therapy is a form of psychotherapy that
involves all the members of a nuclear or extended family.
It may be conducted by a pair or team of therapists. In
many cases the team consists of a man and a woman in
order to treat gender-related issues or serve as role mod-
els for family members. Although some forms of family
therapy are based on behavioral or psychodynamic prin-
ciples, the most widespread form is based on family sys-
tems theory. This approach regards the family, as a
whole, as the unit of treatment, and emphasizes such fac-
tors as relationships and communication patterns rather
than traits or symptoms in individual members.
Family therapy is a relatively recent development in
psychotherapy. It began shortly after World War II, when
doctors, who were treating schizophrenic patients,
noticed that the patients’ families communicated in dis-
turbed ways. The doctors also found that the patients’
symptoms rose or fell according to the level of tension
between their parents. These observations led to consid-
ering a family as an organism or system with its own
internal rules, patterns of functioning, and tendency to
resist change. The therapists started to treat the families
of schizophrenic patients as whole units rather than
focusing on the hospitalized member. They found that in
many cases the family member with schizophrenia
improved when the “patient” was the family system.
(This should not be misunderstood to mean that schizo-
phrenia is caused by family problems, although family
problems may worsen the condition.) This approach of
involving the entire family in the treatment plan and ther-
apy was then applied to families with problems other
than the presence of schizophrenia.
Family therapy is becoming an increasingly com-
mon form of treatment as changes in American society
are reflected in family structures. It has led to two further
developments: couples therapy, which treats relationship

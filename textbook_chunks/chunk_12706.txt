During this session, the patient wears comfortable
clothing, and may sit, stand, walk, or lie on a low
padded table. The practitioner helps the pupil by guid-
ing him or her through a number of movements. The
practitioner may use touch to communicate with the
student, but touch is not used to correct any move-
ments. The purpose of this session is to increase a stu-
dentâ€™s awareness of his or her own movement and
become open to different possibilities for movement.
The instruction can be focused on a particular activity
that the student does every day, or that causes him or
her pain. The student can learn to alter habitual move-
ments and re-educate the neuromuscular system. This
type of session is particularly useful for those who
suffer from limitations originating from misuse,
stress, illness, or accident. It can also help athletes and
musicians perform to the best of their ability by
increasing their possibilities for movement. It offers
students the potential for improving their physical and
mental performance in addition to heightening the
sense of well-being.

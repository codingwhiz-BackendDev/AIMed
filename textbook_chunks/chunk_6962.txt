Cystine is an amino acid. Amino acids are organic
compounds needed by the body to make proteins and for
many normal functions. When the kidneys donâ€™t absorb
cystine, this compound builds up in the urine. When the
amount of cystine in the urine exceeds its solubility (the
greatest amount that can be dissolved), crystals form. As
the amount of cystine continues to increase in the urine,
the number of crystals also increases. When very large
numbers of cystine crystals form, they clump together
into what is called a stone.

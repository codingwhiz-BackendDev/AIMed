Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is a method for
examining the condition of a baby in the uterus by noting
any unusual changes in its heart rate. Electronic fetal moni-
toring is performed late in pregnancy or continuously dur-
ing labor to ensure normal delivery of a healthy baby. EFM
can be utilized either externally or internally in the womb.

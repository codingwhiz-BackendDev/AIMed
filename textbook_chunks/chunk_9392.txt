An ear examination with an otoscope is usually done
by a doctor or a nurse as part of a complete physical
examination. The ears may also be examined if an ear
infection is suspected due to fever, ear pain, or hearing
loss. The patient will often be asked to tip the head
slightly toward the shoulder so the ear to be examined is
pointing up. The doctor or nurse may hold the ear lobe as
the speculum is inserted into the ear, and may adjust the
position of the otoscope to get a better view of the ear
canal and eardrum. Both ears are usually examined, even
if there seems to be a problem with just one ear.

In a normal and well managed delivery, an episioto-
my may be avoided altogether. If an episiotomy is
deemed to be necessary, a simple midline incision will be
made to extend the vaginal opening without additional
tearing or extensive trauma to the perineal area. Although
there may be some pain associated with the healing of
the episiotomy incision, relief can usually be provided
with mild pain relievers and supportive measures, such as
the application of cold packs.

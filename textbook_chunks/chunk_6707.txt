In the United States, the prevalence of dogs and cats
with hookworms is the reason why the infective larvae
are found so commonly in soil and sand. The play habits
of children, together with their attraction to pets, puts
them at high risk for hookworm infection and cutaneous
larvae migrans.
Human hookworm infestation can be prevented by
practicing good personal hygiene, deworming pets, and
not allowing children to play in potentially contaminated
environments.

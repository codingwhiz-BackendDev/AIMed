blood
and urine. The most reliable index of cortisol secretion is
the 24-hour urine sample collection, but when blood lev-
els are required or requested by the physician, plasma
cortisol should be measured in the morning and again in
the afternoon. Cortisol levels normally rise and fall dur-
ing the day in what is called a diurnal variation, so that
cortisol is at its highest level between 6–8 A.M. and grad-
ually falls, reaching its lowest point around midnight.
One reason for ordering blood cortisol levels versus a 24-
hour urine collection is that sometimes the earliest sign
of adrenal malfunction is the loss of this diurnal varia-
tion, even though the cortisol levels are not yet elevated.
For example, individuals with Cushing’s syndrome often
have upper normal plasma cortisol levels in the morning
and exhibit no decline as the day progresses.

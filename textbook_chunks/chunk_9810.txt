shut off. If that cannot be done, and current is still flowing
through the victim, the alternative is to stand on a dry, non-
conducting surface such as a folded newspaper, flattened
cardboard carton, or plastic or rubber mat and use a non-
conducting object such as a wooden broomstick (never a
damp or metallic object) to push the victim away from the
source of the current. The victim and the source of the cur-
rent must not be touched while the current is still flowing,
for this can electrocute the rescuer. Emergency medical
help should be summoned as quickly as possible. People
who are trained to perform cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion (CPR) should, if appropriate, begin first aid while
waiting for emergency medical help to arrive.
Burn victims usually require treatment at a burn cen-
ter. Fluid replacement therapy is necessary to restore lost
fluids and electrolytes. Severely injured tissue is repaired
surgically, which can involve skin grafting or amputa-
tion. Antibiotics and antibacterial creams are used to
prevent infection. Victims may also require treatment for
kidney failure. Following surgery, physical therapy to
facilitate recovery, and psychological counseling to cope
with disfigurement, may be necessary.

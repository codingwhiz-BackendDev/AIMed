Female patients require a pelvic examination as part
of the procedure to obtain urine specimens. The patient
lies on an obstetrical table with legs in the stirrups. The
doctor first takes a vaginal culture smear. The patient is
then asked to void while lying on the table. The first
5â€“10 ml are collected to test for urethral infection. A
midstream urine sample of 200 ml is then collected to
test for bladder infection.
In women, a vaginal bacterial count that is higher
than those of the two urine samples indicates vaginitis. A
high bacterial count in the first urine sample indicates
urethritis. A count of more than 104 bacteria CFU/ml
(colony forming units per milliliter) in the midstream
sample indicates a bladder or kidney infection. A colony
is a large number of microorganisms that grow from a
single cell within a substance called a culture. A bacterial
count can be given in CFU (colony forming units).

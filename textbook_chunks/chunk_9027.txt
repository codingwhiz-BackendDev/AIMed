dose symptoms can include slowed breathing, very low
blood pressure, stupor, coma, shock, and death.
Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause
irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite,
and blurred vision.
Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine,
and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are
also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes
sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart
rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the
black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal,
are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs
are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun-
teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the
patient will stop breathing.
Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or
ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay),
and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp-
toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting,
possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will
cause metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis, con-
ditions where the bodyâ€™s acid/base balance is malfunc-
tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast
breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion,
hallucinations, tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An
increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious
complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart
failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death.

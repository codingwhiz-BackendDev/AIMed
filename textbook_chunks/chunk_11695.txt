Exercise can be very helpful in prevention and
rehabilitation of cardiac disorders and disease. With an
individually designed exercise program set at a level
considered safe for that individual, people with symp-
toms of heart failure can substantially improve their
fitness levels. The greatest benefit occurs as muscles
improve the efficiency of their oxygen use, which
reduces the need for the heart to pump as much blood.
While such exercise doesnâ€™t appear to improve the con-
dition of the heart itself, the increased fitness level
reduces the total workload of the heart. The related
increase in endurance should also translate into a gener-
ally more active lifestyle. Endurance or aerobic rou-
tines, such as running, brisk walking, cycling, or swim-
ming, increase the strength and efficiency of the mus-
cles of the heart.

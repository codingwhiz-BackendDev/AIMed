DiGeorge syndrome (also called congenital thymic
hypoplasia, or third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syn-
drome) is a birth defect that is caused by an abnormal
chromosome and affects the babyâ€™s immune system. The
syndrome is marked by absence or underdevelopment of
the thymus and parathyroid glands. It is named for the
pediatrician who first described it in 1965.

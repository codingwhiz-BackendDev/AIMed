Endometrial cancer (also called uterine cancer) is
the fourth most common type of cancer among women
and the most common gynecologic cancer. Approximate-
ly 34,000 women are diagnosed with endometrial cancer
each year. In 1998, approximately 6,300 women died
from this cancer. Although endometrial cancer generally
occurs in women who have gone through menopause
and are 45 years of age or older, 30% of the women with
endometrial cancer are younger than 40 years of age. The
average age at diagnosis is 60 years old.
The uterus, or womb, is the hollow female organ that
supports the development of the unborn baby during
pregnancy. The uterus has a thick muscular wall and an
inner lining called the endometrium. The endometrium is
very sensitive to hormones and it changes daily during
the menstrual cycle. The endometrium is designed to
provide an ideal environment for the fertilized egg to
implant and begin to grow. If pregnancy does not occur,
the endometrium is shed causing the menstrual period.
More than 95% of uterine cancers arise in the
endometrium. The most common type of uterine cancer
is adenocarcinoma. It arises from an abnormal multipli-
cation of endometrial cells (atypical adenomatous hyper-
plasia) and is made up of mature, specialized cells (well-
differentiated). Less commonly, endometrial cancer aris-
es without a preceding hyperplasia and is made up of
poorly differentiated cells. The more common of these
types are the papillary serous and clear cell carcinomas.
Poorly differentiated endometrial cancers are often asso-
ciated with a less promising prognosis.
The highest incidence of endometrial cancer in the
United States is in Caucasians, Hawaiians, Japanese, and
African Americans. American Indians, Koreans, and
Vietnamese have the lowest incidence. African American
and Hawaiian women are more likely to be diagnosed
with advanced cancer and, therefore, have a higher risk
of dying from the disease.

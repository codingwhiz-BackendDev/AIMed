Antibody—Specialized cells of the immune sys-
tem that can recognize organisms invading the
body (like bacteria, viruses, and fungi). The anti-
bodies are then able to start a complex chain of
events designed to kill these foreign invaders.
Autoimmune disorder—A disorder in which the
body’s antibodies mistake the body’s own tissues
for foreign invaders. The immune system then
attacks and causes damage to these tissues.
Immune system—The system of specialized organs,
lymph nodes, and blood cells throughout the body
that work together to defend the body against for-
eign invaders (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.).
disk is performed to treat back pain that has lasted at least
six weeks as a result of an abnormal disk and that has not
responded to conservative treatment. Surgery is also per-
formed if there is pressure on the lumbosacral nerve roots
that causes weakness or bowel or bladder disfunction.
As a person ages, the disks between the vertebrae
degenerate and dry out, and the fibers holding them in
place tear. Eventually, the disk can form a blister-like
bulge, compressing nerves in the spine and causing pain.
This is called a “prolapsed” (or herniated) disk. If such a
disk causes muscle weakness or interferes with bladder
or bowel function because it is pressing on a nerve root,
immediate surgery to remove the disk may be needed.
The aim of the surgery is to try to relieve all pressure
on nerve roots by removing the pulpy material from the
disk, or the disk itself. If it is necessary to remove materi-
al from several nearby vertebrae, the spine may become
unsteady. In this case, the surgeon will perform a spinal
fusion, removing all the disks between two or more verte-
brae and roughening the bones so that the vertebrae heal
together. Bone strips taken from the patient’s leg or hip
may be used to help hold the vertebrae together. Spinal
fusion decreases pain but it also decreases spinal mobility.

During infancy, the diagnosis of cri du chat syn-
drome is strongly suspected if the characteristic cat-like
cry is heard. If a child has this unusual cry or other fea-
tures seen in cri du chat syndrome, chromosome testing
should be performed. Chromosome analysis provides the
definitive diagnosis of cri du chat syndrome and can be
performed from a blood test. Chromosome analysis, also
called “karyotyping,” involves staining the chromosomes
and examining them under a microscope. In some cases
the deletion of material from chromosome 5 can be easi-
ly seen. In other cases, further testing must be performed.
FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization) is a special
technique that detects very small deletions. The majority
of the deletions that cause cri du chat syndrome can be
identified using the FISH technique.

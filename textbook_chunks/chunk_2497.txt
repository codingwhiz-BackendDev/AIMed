CMT is caused by changes (mutations) in any one of
a number of genes that carry the instructions to make the
peripheral nerves. Genes contain the instructions for how
the body grows and develops before and after a person is
born. There are probably at least 15 different genes that
can cause CMT. However, as of early 2001, many have
not yet been identified.
CMT types 1 and 2 can be broken down into sub-
types based upon the gene that is causing CMT. The sub-
types are labeled by letters, so there is CMT1A, CMT1B,
etc. Therefore, the gene with a mutation that causes
CMT1A is different from that that causes CMT1B.

The carpal tunnel is an area in the wrist where the
bones and ligaments create a small passageway for the
median nerve. The median nerve is responsible for both
sensation and movement in the hand, in particular the
thumb and first three fingers. When the median nerve is
compressed, an individual’s hand will feel as if it has
“gone to sleep.”
Women between the ages of 30 and 60 have the
highest rates of carpal tunnel syndrome. Research has
demonstrated that carpal tunnel syndrome is a very sig-
nificant cause of missed work days due to pain. In 1995,
about $270 million was spent on sick days taken for pain
from repetitive motion injuries.

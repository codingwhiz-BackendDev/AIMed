Diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome can be made by
ultrasound examination around the eighteenth week of
pregnancy, when abnormalities in the development of the
heart or the palate can be detected. Another technique
that is used to diagnose the syndrome before birth is
called fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH. This
technique uses DNA probes from the DiGeorge region
on chromosome 22. FISH can be performed on cell sam-
ples obtained by amniocentesis as early as the fourteenth
week of pregnancy. It confirms about 95% of cases of
DiGeorge syndrome.
If the mother has not had prenatal testing, the diag-
nosis of DiGeorge syndrome is sometimes suggested by
the childâ€™s facial features at birth. In other cases, the doc-
tor makes the diagnosis during heart surgery when he or
she notices the absence or abnormal location of the thy-
mus gland. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood
tests for calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone
levels, and by the sheep cell test for immune function.

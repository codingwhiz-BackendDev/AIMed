The most common cause of corneal ulcers is germs,
but most of them cannot invade a healthy cornea with
adequate tears and a functioning eyelid. They gain access
because injury has impaired these defense mechanisms.
A direct injury from a foreign object inoculates germs
directly through the outer layer of the cornea, just as it
does to the skin. A caustic chemical can inflame the
cornea by itself or so damage it that germs can invade.
Improper use of contact lenses has become a common
cause of corneal injury. Eyelid or tear function failure is
the other way to make the eye vulnerable to infection.
Tears and the eyelid together wash the eye and prevent
foreign material from settling in. Tears contain enzymes
and other substances to help protect against infection.
Certain diseases dry up tear production, leaving the
cornea dry and defenseless. Other diseases paralyze or
weaken the eyelids so that they cannot effectively protect
and cleanse the eyes.

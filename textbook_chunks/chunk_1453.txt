Prevention is generally aimed at becoming aware of
the repetitive motions which one must make which could
put the wrist into a bent position. People who must work
long hours at a computer keyboard, for example, may need
to take advantage of recent advances in “ergonomics,”
which try to position the keyboard and computer compo-
nents in a way that increases efficiency and decreases
stress. Early use of a splint may also be helpful for people
whose jobs increase the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.

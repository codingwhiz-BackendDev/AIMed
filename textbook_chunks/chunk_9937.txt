Patients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being
shown video tapes that explain both the procedure and the
risks involved. The physician then answers any questions
these individuals may have, and the patient is asked to
sign an “Informed Consent Form.” This gives the doctor
and the hospital permission to administer the treatment.
Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com-
plete physical examination, and orders a number of
tests that can help identify any potential problem. These
tests may include a chest x ray, an electrocardiogram
(ECG), urinalysis, spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and
complete blood count (CBC).
Some medications, such as lithium and a type of anti-
depressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors,
should be discontinued for some time before treatment.
Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eight
hours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi-
bility of vomiting and choking.

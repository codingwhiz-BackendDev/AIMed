The exact cause of congenital amputations is
unknown. However, according to the March of Dimes,
most birth defects have one or more genetic factors and
one or more environmental factors. It is also known that
most birth defects occur in the first three months of preg-
nancy, when the organs of the fetus are forming. Within
these crucial first weeks, frequently prior to when a
woman is aware of the pregnancy, the developing fetus is
most susceptible to substances that can cause birth
defects (teratogens). Exposure to teratogens can cause
congenital amputation. In other cases, tight amniotic
bands may constrict the developing fetus, preventing a
limb from forming properly, if at all. It is estimated that
this amniotic band syndrome occurs in between one in
12,000 and one in 15,000 live births.
An infant with congenital amputation may be miss-
ing an entire limb or just a portion of a limb. Congenital
amputation resulting in the complete absence of a limb
beyond a certain point (and leaving a stump) is called
transverse deficiency or amelia. Longitudinal deficien-
cies occur when a specific part of a limb is missing; for
example, when the fibula bone in the lower leg is miss-
ing, but the rest of the leg is intact. Phocomelia is the
condition in which only a mid-portion of a limb is miss-
ing, as when the hands or feet are attached directly to
the trunk.

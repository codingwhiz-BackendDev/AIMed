He devised a method of re-educating the neuromuscular
system and re-evaluating movement to increase effi-
ciency and reduce stress, using his knowledge of
mechanics and engineering, and applying some of his
martial arts training.
Feldenkrais is described a being a dual system, with
two components: “Awareness Through Movement” and
“Functional Integration.” The system aims to re-educate
the body so that habitual movements that cause strain or
pain can be relearned to improve efficiency and eliminate
dangerous or painful action.
Feldenkrais helps to translate intention into action.
In practice, an individual can learn to achieve his or her
highest potential, while at the same time learning to
avoid and eliminate stresses, strains, and the possibility
of injury.

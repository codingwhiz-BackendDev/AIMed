Because cell therapy encompasses such a wide range
of treatments and applications, and many of these treat-
ments are still experimental, the full range of possible
side effects of the treatments are not yet known. Anaphy-
lactic shock (severe allergic reaction), immune system
reactions, and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)
are just a few of the known reported side effects in some
patients to date.
Side effects of the FDA-approved chondrocyte cell
therapy used in knee joint repair may include tissue
hypertrophy, a condition where too much cartilage grows
in the joint where the cells were transplanted to and the
knee joint begins to stiffen.

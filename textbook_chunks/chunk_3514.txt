Cholinergic drugs usually act in one of two ways.
Some directly mimic the effect of acetylcholine, while
others block the effects of acetylcholinesterase. Acetyl-
cholinesterase is an enzyme that destroys naturally
occurring acetylcholine. By blocking the enzyme, the
naturally occurring acetylcholine has a longer action.

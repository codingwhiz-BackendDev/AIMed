Cerumen impaction develops when earwax accumu-
lates in the inner part of the ear canal and blocks the
eardrum. It affects between 2â€“6% of the general popula-
tion in the United States. Impaction does not happen
under normal circumstances because cerumen is pro-
duced by glands in the outer part of the ear canal; it is not
produced in the inner part. The cerumen traps sand or
dust particles before they reach the ear drum. It also pro-
tects the outer part of the ear canal because it repels
water. The slow movement of the outer layer of skin of
the ear canal carries cerumen toward the outer opening of
the ear. As the older cerumen reaches the opening of the
ear, it dries out and falls away.

(1) those done with
the use of barium and a fluoroscope; and (2) those per-
formed with radioactive materials.
Studies performed with fluoroscopy are of greatest
value in identifying a structural abnormality of the esoph-
agus. Although this is not truly an esophageal function
test, it does allow doctors to consider other diagnostic
possibilities. Often a sandwich or marshmallow coated
with barium is used to identify the site of an obstruction.
During fluoroscopy, the radiologist can observe the
passage of material through the esophagus in real time,
and video recordings can also be done. This is particularly
useful when the swallowing symptoms appear to involve
mainly the upper region of the esophagus. The most com-
mon cause of swallowing difficulties is a previous stroke,
although other diseases of the neuromuscular system (like
myasthenia gravis) can produce the same symptoms.
Scans using low-dose radioactive materials are use-
ful because they are able not only to demonstrate that
food passes through the esophagus more slowly than nor-
mal, but also how slow. These studies involve swallow-
ing food coated with material that is followed by a
nuclear medicine scanner. Scans are best used when
other methods have failed to make a diagnosis, or if it is
necessary to determine the degree of the abnormality. As
of 1997, scans mainly served as research tools.

The gene for FA codes for a protein called frataxin.
Normal frataxin is found in the cellular energy structures
known as mitochondria, where it is thought to be
involved in regulating the transport of iron. In FA, the
frataxin gene on chromosome 9 is expanded with non-
sense information known as a “triple repeat.” This extra
DNA interferes with normal production of frataxin,
thereby impairing iron transport. Normally, there are 10-
21 repeats of the frataxin gene. In FA, this sequence may
be repeated between 200-900 times. The types of symp-
toms and severity of FA seems to be associated with the
number of repetitions. Patients with more copies have
more severe symptomatology. Researchers are still
wrestling with how frataxin and the repeats on chromo-
some 9 are involved in causing FA. One theory suggests
that FA develops in part because defects in iron transport
prevent efficient use of cellular energy supplies.
The nerve cells most affected by FA are those in the
spinal cord involved in relaying information between
muscles and the brain. Tight control of movement
requires complex feedback between the muscles promot-
ing a movement, those restraining it, and the brain. With-
out this control, movements become uncoordinated,
jerky, and inappropriate to the desired action.

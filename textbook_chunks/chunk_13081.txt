The condition known as atypical ductal hyperplasia
(ADH) is a condition in which the cells lining the milk
ducts of the breast are growing abnormally. This condi-
tion may appear as spots of calcium salts, or calcifica-
tions, on the mammogram. A biopsy removed from the
breast would confirm the diagnosis. Atypical ductal
hyperplasia is not a cancer. In most women, this condi-
tion will cause no problems. However, for some women,
especially women with family histories of breast cancer,
the risk of developing breast cancer is increased. (One
study with over 3,000 female participants indicated that
about 20% of the participants with atypical hyperplasia
and a family history of breast cancer developed breast
cancer, as compared to the 8% of participants who devel-
oped the disease with atypical hyperplasia and no family
history of breast cancer.) For women with ADH and a
family history of breast cancer, more frequent mammo-
grams and closer monitoring may be required.

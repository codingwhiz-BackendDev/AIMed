A variety of nutritional supplements are used for
treatment of CFS. Among these are vitamin C, vitamin
B12, vitamin A, vitamin E, and various dietary minerals.
These supplements may help improve immune and men-
tal functions. Several herbs have been shown to improve
immune function and have other beneficial effects. Some
that are used for CFS are astragalus (Astragalus mem-
branaceus), echinacea (Echinacea spp.), garlic (Allium
sativum), ginseng (Panax ginseng), gingko (Gingko bilo-
ba), evening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis), shiitake
mushroom extract (Lentinus edodes), borage seed oil,
and quercetin.
Many people have enhanced their healing process
for CFS with the use of a treatment program inclusive of
one or more alternative therapies. Stress reduction tech-
niques such as biofeedback, meditation, acupuncture,
and yoga may help people with sleep disturbances relax
and get more rest. They also help some people reduce
depression and anxiety caused by CFS.

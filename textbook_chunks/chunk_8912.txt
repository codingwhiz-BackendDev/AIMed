Doppler ultrasonography makes use of two different
principles. The ultrasound principle is this: when a high-
frequency sound is produced and aimed at a target, it will
be reflected by its target and the reflected sound can be
detected back at its origin. In addition, it is known that
certain crystals (called piezoelectric crystals) produce an
electrical pulse when vibrated by a returning sound.
The Doppler principle is simply that sound pitch
increases as the source moves toward the listener and
decreases as it moves away.
Medical science utilizes these two principles in the
following way. A transducer (sometimes called a probe)
containing piezoelectric crystals sends a series of short
sound pulses into the body and pauses between each
pulse to listen for the returning sounds. The machine
then determines the direction and depth of each returning
sound and coverts this into a point of light on a television
monitor. Thousands of these pulses are computed and
displayed every second to produce an image of the organ
being studied. The image allows the doctor to see the
organ functioning in real time.
The newest addition to this test is the addition of
color. Adding color to the image shows the direction and
rate of blood flow more clearly.
During a Doppler ultrasonography procedure the
technician will apply a gel to the skin, then place the
transducer against the skin at various angles. The trans-
ducer sends the information it receives to a television
monitor that shows a moving image of the organ being
studied. The technician can save these images either on
video tape, paper, or x-ray film for further study.

Choriocarcinomas are usually referred to an
oncologist, a doctor who specializes in cancer treat-
ment. To diagnose this tumor, the doctor will do a
physical examination and examine the internal
organs with x rays or ultrasound studies. Choriocarci-
nomas are not always biopsied before being treated,
because they tend to bleed heavily. Spreading of the
cancer is detected with x rays, ultrasound studies,
computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scans.
Most choriocarcinomas make human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone normally found only
during pregnancy. The presence of hCG in the blood can
help diagnose this cancer and monitor the success of
treatment.

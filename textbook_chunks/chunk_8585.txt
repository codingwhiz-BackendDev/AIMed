Diphtheria patients need bed rest with intensive
nursing care, including extra fluids, oxygenation, and
monitoring for possible heart problems, airway blockage,
or involvement of the nervous system. Patients with
laryngeal diphtheria are kept in a croup tent or high-
humidity environment; they may also need throat suc-
tioning or emergency surgery if their airway is blocked.
Patients recovering from diphtheria should rest at
home for a minimum of two to three weeks, especially if
they have heart complications. In addition, patients
should be immunized against diphtheria after recovery,
because having the disease does not always induce anti-
toxin formation and protect them from reinfection.

Antibiotics are given to wipe out the bacteria, to
prevent the spread of the disease, and to protect the
patient from developing pneumonia. They are not a sub-
stitute for treatment with antitoxin. Both adults and chil-
dren may be given penicillin, ampicillin, or ery-
thromycin. Erythromycin appears to be more effective
than penicillin in treating people who are carriers
because of better penetration into the infected area.
Cutaneous diphtheria is usually treated by cleansing
the wound thoroughly with soap and water, and giving
the patient antibiotics for 10 days.

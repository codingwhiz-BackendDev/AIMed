Most ear surgery is microsurgery, performed with an
operating microscope to enable the surgeon to view the
very small structures of the ear. The use of minimally
invasive laser surgery for middle ear procedures is
growing. Laser surgery reduces the amount of trauma
due to vibration, enhances coagulation, and enables sur-
geons to access hard to reach places in the middle ear.
Laser surgery can be performed in an office operating
suite. Types of ear surgery include stapedectomy, tym-
panoplasty, myringotomy and ear tube surgery, ear
surgery to repair a perforated eardrum, cochlear
implants, and tumor removal.

In women who are especially sensitive to oxytocin,
the drug may cause contractions to become too strong.
This could tear the uterus or deprive the fetus of blood
and oxygen during labor.
Oxytocin does not help improve milk flow in all
women who are breastfeeding. Check with a physician if
the drug does not seem to be working.
Women with heart disease, high blood pressure, or
kidney disease should let their physicians know about
these conditions before taking oxytocin. Also, anyone
who has had an unusual reaction to oxytocin in the past
should inform their physician.

Fanconiâ€™s syndrome is a set of kidney malfunctions
brought about by a variety of seemingly unrelated disor-
ders. Kidney malfunction leads to excessive urine produc-
tion and excessive thirst, resulting in deficits of water, cal-
cium, potassium, magnesium, and other substances in the
body. It often leads to bone disease and stunted growth.

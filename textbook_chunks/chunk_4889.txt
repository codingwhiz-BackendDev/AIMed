Contrast agents are often used in CT exams and in
other radiology procedures to illuminate certain details
of anatomy which may not be easily seen. Some con-
trasts are natural, such as air or water. Other times, a
water-based contrast agent is administered for specific
diagnostic purposes. Barium sulfate is commonly used in
gastroenterology procedures. The patient may drink this
contrast, or receive it in an enema. Oral and rectal con-
trast are usually given when examining the abdomen or
cells, and not given when scanning the brain or chest.
Iodine is the most widely used intravenous contrast agent
and is given through an intravenous needle.
If contrast agents are used in the CT exam, these will
be administered several minutes before the study begins.
Abdominal CT patients may be asked to drink a contrast
medium. Some patients may experience a salty taste, flush-
ing of the face, warmth or slight nausea, or hives from an
intravenous contrast injection. Technologists and radiolo-
gists have equipment and training to help patients through
these minor reactions and to handle more severe reactions.
Severe reactions to contrast are rare, but do occur.

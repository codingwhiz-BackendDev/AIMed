Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of rare inherited
skin diseases that are characterized by the development of
blisters following minimal pressure to the skin. Blistering
often appears in infancy in response to simply being held or
handled. In rarer forms of the disorder, EB can be life-
threatening. There is no cure for the disorder. Treatment
focuses on preventing and treating wounds and infection.

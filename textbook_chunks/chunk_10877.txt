The disease is highly contagious and is caused by a
parasitic worm called Enterobius vermicularis. The adult
female worm is about the size of a staple (approximately
0.4 in [1 cm] long and 0.02 in [0.5 mm] wide) and has a
pointed tip. The disease is transmitted by ingesting the
eggs of the pinworm. These eggs travel to the small intes-
tine where, after approximately one month, they hatch
and mature into adult worms. During the night, the
female adult worms travel to the area around the anus
and deposit eggs in the folds of the anal area. A single
female pinworm can lay 10,000 eggs and, after laying
eggs, dies. The eggs are capable of causing infection
after six hours at body temperature.
Significant itching in the anal region is caused by the
movement of the adult worm as the eggs are deposited.
When an individual scratches the anal region, the tiny eggs
get under the finger nails and in the underwear and night
clothes. Anything the individual touches with the contami-
nated fingers, for example, toys, bedding, blankets, bath-
room door knobs, or sinks, becomes contaminated. The
eggs are very hardy and can live on surfaces for two to
three weeks. Anyone touching these contaminated sur-
faces can ingest the eggs and become infected. An individ-

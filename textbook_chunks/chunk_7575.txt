Treatment of delirium begins with recognizing and
treating the underlying cause. Delirium itself is managed
by reducing disturbing stimuli, or providing soothing
ones; use of simple, clear language in communication;
and reassurance, especially from family members. Physi-
cal restraints may be needed if the patient is a danger to
himself or others, or if he insists on removing necessary
medical equipment such as intravenous lines or monitors.
Sedatives or antipsychotic drugs may be used to reduce
anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions.

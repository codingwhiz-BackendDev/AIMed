Frostbite diagnosis relies on a physical examina-
tion and may also include conventional radiography (x
rays), angiography (x-ray examination of the blood ves-
sels using an injected dye to provide contrast), thermog-
raphy (use of a heat-sensitive device for measuring blood
flow), and other techniques for predicting the course of
injury and identifying tissue that requires surgical
removal. During the initial treatment period, however, a
physician cannot judge how a case will progress. Diag-
nostic tests only become useful three to five days after
rewarming, once the blood vessels have stabilized.

According to a 2001 report from the CDC, Salmo-
nella caused almost 50,000 culture-confirmed cases of
food poisoning in the United States annually. However,
between two and four million probably occur each year.
Salmonella is found in egg yolks from infected chickens,
in raw and undercooked poultry and in other meats, dairy
products, fish, shrimp, and many more foods. The CDC
estimates that one out of every 50 consumers is exposed
to a contaminated egg yolk each year. However, thorough
cooking kills the bacteria and makes the food harmless.
Salmonella is also found in the feces of pet reptiles such
as turtles, lizards, and snakes.
About one out of every 1,000 people get food poi-
soning from Salmonella. Of these, two-thirds are under
age 20, with the majority under age nine. Most cases
occur in the warm months between July and October.

Central nervous system stimulants are used to treat
conditions characterized by lack of adrenergic stimula-
tion, including narcolepsy and neonatal apnea. Addition-
ally, methylphenidate (Ritalin) and dextroamphetamine
sulfate (Dexedrine) are used for their paradoxical effect
in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
The anerexiants, benzphetamine (Didrex), diethyl-
propion (Tenuate), phendimetrazine (Bontril, Plegine),
phentermine (Fastin,
Ionamine),
and sibutramine
(Meridia) are CNS stimulants used for appetite reduction
in severe obesity. Although these drugs are structurally
similar to amphetamine, they cause less sensation of
stimulation, and are less suited for use in conditions
characterized by lack of adrenergic stimulation.
Phenylpropanolamine and ephedrine have been used
both as diet aids and as vasoconstrictors.

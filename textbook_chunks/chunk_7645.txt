• Memory losses. Memory loss is usually the first symp-
tom noticed. It may begin with misplacing valuables
such as a wallet or car keys, then progress to forgetting
appointments, where the car was left, and the route
home, for instance. More profound losses follow, such
as forgetting the names and faces of family members.
• Impaired abstraction and planning. The person with
dementia may lose the ability to perform familiar tasks, to
plan activities, and to draw simple conclusions from facts.
• Language and comprehension disturbances. The person
may be unable to understand instructions, or follow the
logic of moderately complex sentences. Later, he or she
may not understand his or her own sentences, and have
difficulty forming thoughts into words.
• Poor judgment. The person may not recognize the con-
sequences of his or her actions or be able to evaluate the
appropriateness of behavior. Behavior may become rib-
ald, overly-friendly, or aggressive. Personal hygiene
may be ignored.
• Impaired orientation ability. The person may not be
able to identify the time of day, even from obvious
visual clues; or may not recognize his or her location,
even if familiar. This disability may stem partly from
losses of memory and partly from impaired abstraction.
• Decreased attention and increased restlessness. This
may cause the person with dementia to begin an activity
and quickly lose interest, and to wander frequently.
Wandering may cause significant safety problems, when
combined with disorientation and memory losses. The
person may begin to cook something on the stove, then
become distracted and wander away while it is cooking.
• Personality changes and psychosis. The person may
lose interest in once-pleasurable activities, and become
more passive, depressed, or anxious. Delusions, suspi-
cion, paranoia, and hallucinations may occur later in
the disease. Sleep disturbances may occur, including
insomnia and sleep interruptions.

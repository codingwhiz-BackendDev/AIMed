When a doctor is evaluating a patient with dissocia-
tive symptoms, he or she will first rule out physical con-
ditions that sometimes produce amnesia, depersonaliza-
tion, or derealization. These physical conditions include
epilepsy, head injuries, brain disease, side effects of med-
ications, substance abuse, intoxication, AIDS, dementia
complex, or recent periods of extreme physical stress
and sleeplessness. In some cases, the doctor may give the
patient an electroencephalogram (EEG) to exclude
epilepsy or other seizure disorders.
If the patient appears to be physically normal, the
doctor will rule out psychotic disturbances, including
schizophrenia. In addition, doctors can use some psy-
chological tests to narrow the diagnosis. One is a screen-
er, the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). If the
patient has a high score on this test, he or she can be eval-
uated further with the Dissociative Disorders Interview
Schedule (DDIS) or the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D). It is also pos-
sible for doctors to measure a patientâ€™s hypnotizability as
part of a diagnostic evaluation.

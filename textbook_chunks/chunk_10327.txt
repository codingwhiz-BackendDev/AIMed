Empyema may have a number of causes but is most
frequently a complication of pneumonia. Its develop-
ment can be divided into three phases: an acute phase in
which the body cavity fills with a thin fluid containing
some pus; a second stage in which the fluid thickens and
a fibrous, coagulation protein (fibrin) begins to accumu-
late within the cavity; and a third or chronic stage in
which the lung or other organ is encased within a thick
covering of fibrous material.

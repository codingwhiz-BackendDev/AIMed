HDL and LDL levels do not. New studies indicate it may
be due to the size of the cholesterol particles in the
bloodstream. A test called a nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) LipoProfile exposes a blood sample to a magnet-
ic field to determine the size of the cholesterol particles.
Particle size can also be determined by a centrifugation
test, where blood samples are spun very quickly to allow
particles to separate and move at different distances. The
smaller the particles, the greater the chance of develop-
ing heart disease. It allows physicians to treat patients
who have normal or close to normal results from a lipid
panel but abnormal particle size.

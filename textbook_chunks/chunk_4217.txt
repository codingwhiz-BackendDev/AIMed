To date, no medications have been approved specifi-
cally for treating cocaine addiction. But several were
under development at this writing. Selegeline, delivered
either via a time-release pill or a transdermal patch,
shows promise as a possible anti-cocaine medication.
Clinical studies have shown the drug disulfiram (also
used to treat alcoholics) to be effective in treating
cocaine abusers. In addition, antidepressant medications
are sometimes used to control the mood swings associat-
ed with the early stages of cocaine withdrawal.

Most women who have endometriosis have minimal
symptoms and do well. Overall, endometriosis symp-
toms come back in an average of 40% of women over the
five years following treatment. With hormonal therapy,
pain returned after five years in 37% of patients with
minimal symptoms and 74% of those with severe cases.
The highest success rate from conservative treatment fol-
lowed complete removal of implants using laser surgery.
Eighty percent of these women were still pain-free five
years later. In cases that donâ€™t respond to these treat-
ments, a woman and her doctor may consider surgery to
remove her reproductive organs.

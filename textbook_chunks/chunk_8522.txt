When performing a D & C, the physician inserts a speculum
to separate and hold the vaginal walls, then stretches open
the cervix with a dilator. Once the cervix is dilated, the
physician will insert a curette into the uterus and scrapes
away small portions of the uterine lining for laboratory
analysis. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
vaginal walls, and then stretches the opening of the
uterus to the vagina (the cervix) by inserting a series of
tapering rods, each thicker than the previous one, or by
using other specialized instruments. This process of
opening the cervix is called dilation.
Once the cervix is dilated, the physician inserts a
spoon-shaped surgical device called a curette into the
uterus. The curette is used to scrape away the uterine lin-
ing. One or more small tissue samples from the lining of
the uterus or the cervical canal are sent for analysis by
microscope to check for abnormal cells.
Although simpler, less expensive techniques such as
a vacuum aspiration are quickly replacing the D & C as a
diagnostic method, it is still often used to diagnose and
treat a number of conditions.

Delirium is a syndrome, or group of symptoms,
caused by a disturbance in the normal functioning of the
brain. The delirious patient has a reduced awareness of
and responsiveness to the environment, which may be
manifested as disorientation, incoherence, and memory
disturbance. Delirium is often marked by hallucinations,
delusions, and a dream-like state.
Delirium affects at least one in 10 hospitalized
patients, and is a common part of many terminal illness-
es. Delirium is more common in the elderly than in the
general population. While it is not a specific disease
itself, patients with delirium usually fare worse than
those with the same illness who do not have delirium.

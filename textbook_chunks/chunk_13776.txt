Both children and adults experience problems
caused by foreign objects getting stuck in their bodies.
Young children, in particular, are naturally curious and
may intentionally put shiny objects, such as coins or
button batteries, into their mouths. They also like to
stick things in their ears and up their noses. Adults may
accidentally swallow a non-food object or inhale a for-
eign body that gets stuck in the throat. Even if an object
like a toothpick successfully passes through the esopha-
gus and into the stomach, it can get stuck inside the rec-
tum. Airborne particles can lodge in the eyes of people
at any age.
Foreign bodies can be in hollow organs (like swal-
lowed batteries) or in tissues (like bullets). They can be
inert or irritating. If they irritate they will cause inflam-
mation and scarring. They can bring infection with them
or acquire it and protect it from the bodyâ€™s immune
defenses. They can obstruct passageways either by their
size or by the scarring they cause. Some can be toxic.

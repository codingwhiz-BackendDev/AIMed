The symptoms of food poisoning occur because
food-borne bacteria release toxins or poisons as a
byproduct of their growth in the body. These toxins
(except those from C. botulinum) cause inflammation
and swelling of the stomach, small intestine and/or large
intestine. The result is abdominal muscle cramping,
vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and the chance of dehydra-
tion. The severity of symptoms depends on the type of
bacteria, the amount consumed, and the individualâ€™s gen-
eral health and sensitivity to the bacterial toxin.

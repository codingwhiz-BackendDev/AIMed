Echinacea is considered safe in recommended doses.
Pregnant or lactating women, however, are advised not to
take echinacea in injection form. Because the plant has
proven immuno-modulating properties, individuals with
systemic lupus erythmatosus, rheumatoid arthritis,
tuberculosis, leukemia, multiple sclerosis, or AIDS
should consult their physician before using echinacea.
Echinacea should not be given to children under two
years of age, and it should only be given to children over
two in consultation with a physician. Research indicates
that echinacea is most effective when taken at first onset
of symptoms of cold or flu, and when usage is continued
no longer than eight weeks. There is some indication that
the herb loses its effectiveness when used over a long
period of time. It is necessary to interrupt use for a mini-
mum of several weeks in order to give the bodyâ€™s
immune system the opportunity to rest and adjust.

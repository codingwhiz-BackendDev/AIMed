Alternative treatment for cystitis may emphasize elim-
inating all sugar from the diet and drinking lots of water.
Drinking unsweetened cranberry juice not only adds fluid,
but is also thought to help prevent cystitis by making it
more difficult for bacteria to cling to the bladder wall. A
variety of herbal therapies are also recommended. General-
ly, the recommended herbs are antimicrobials, such as gar-
lic (Allium sativum), goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis),
and bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), and/or demul-
cents that soothe and coat the urinary tract, including corn
silk and marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis).
Homeopathic medicine can also be effective in treat-
ing cystitis. Choosing the correct remedy based on the
individualâ€™s symptoms is always key to the success of
this type of treatment. Acupuncture and Chinese tradi-
tional herbal medicine can also be helpful in treating
acute and chronic cases of cystitis.

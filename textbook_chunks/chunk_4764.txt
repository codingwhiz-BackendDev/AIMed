Colds, sometimes called rhinovirus or coronavirus
infections, are the most common illness to strike any part
of the body. It is estimated that the average person has
more than 50 colds during a lifetime. Anyone can get a
cold, although pre-school and grade school children
catch them more frequently than adolescents and adults.
Repeated exposure to viruses causing colds creates par-
tial immunity.
Although most colds resolve on their own without
complications, they are a leading cause of visits to the
doctor and of time lost from work and school. Treating
symptoms of the common cold has given rise to a multi-
million dollar industry in over-the-counter medications.
Cold season in the United States begins in early
autumn and extends through early spring. Although it is
not true that getting wet or being in a draft causes a cold
(a person has to come in contact with the virus to catch a
cold), certain conditions may lead to increased suscepti-
bility. These include:
• fatigue and overwork
• emotional stress
• poor nutrition
• smoking
• living or working in crowded conditions

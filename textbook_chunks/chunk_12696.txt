The Feldenkrais method is an educational system
that allows the body to move and function more effi-
ciently and comfortably. Its goal is to re-educate the
nervous system and improve motor ability. The system
can accomplish much more, relieving pressure on joints
and weak points, and allowing the body to heal repeti-
tive strain injuries. Continued use of the method can
relieve pain and lead to higher standards of achieve-
ment in sports, the martial arts, dancing and other phys-
ical disciplines.
Pupils are taught to become aware of their move-
ments and to become aware of how they use their bodies,
thus discovering possible areas of stress and strain. The
goal of Feldenkrais is to take the individual from merely
functioning, to functioning well, free of pain and restric-
tion of movement. Feldenkrais himself stated that his
goal was, “To make the impossible possible, the possible
easy, and the easy, elegant.”

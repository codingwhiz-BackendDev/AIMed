DES (diethylstilbestrol) is a hormone that was pre-
scribed for pregnant women in the 1950s and early
1960s. Many years later, doctors discovered that the
daughters of the women who received DES were at high
risk for a variety of problems, including infertility, pre-
mature labor, and cancer of the vagina and cervix.

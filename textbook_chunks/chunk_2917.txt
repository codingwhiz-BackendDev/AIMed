Notification of the appropriate authorities, treatment
of the child’s injuries, and protecting the child from fur-
ther harm are the immediate priorities in abuse cases. If
the child does not require hospital treatment, protection
often involves placing him or her with relatives or in fos-
ter care. Once the immediate concerns are dealt with, it
becomes essential to determine how the child’s long-
term medical, psychological, educational, and other
needs can best be met, a process that involves evaluating
not only the child’s needs but also the family’s (such as
for drug abuse counseling or parental skills training). If
the child has brothers or sisters, the authorities must
determine whether they have been abused as well. On
investigation, signs of physical abuse are discovered in
about 20% of the brothers and sisters of abused children.

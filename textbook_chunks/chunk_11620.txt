EGD is safe and well tolerated; however, complica-
tions can occur as with any procedure. These are most
often due to medications used during the procedure, or
are related to endoscopic therapy. The overall complica-
tion rate of EGD is less than 2%, and many of these com-
plications are minor (such as inflammation of the vein
through which medication is given). However, serious
ones can and do occur, and almost half of them are relat-
ed to the heart or lungs. Bleeding or perforations (holes
in the gastrointestinal tract) are also reported, especially
when tumors or narrowed areas are treated or biopsied.
Infections have also been rarely transmitted; improved
cleaning techniques should be able to prevent them.

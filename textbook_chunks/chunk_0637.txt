Caffeine cannot replace sleep and should not be used
regularly to stay awake as the drug can lead to more seri-
ous sleep disorders, like insomnia.
People who use large amounts of caffeine over long
periods build up a tolerance to it. When that happens,
they have to use more and more caffeine to get the same
effects. Heavy caffeine use can also lead to dependence.
If the person then stops using caffeine abruptly, with-
drawal symptoms may occur. These can include throb-
bing headaches, fatigue, drowsiness, yawning, irritabili-
ty, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose. These symp-
toms can go on for as long as a week if caffeine is avoid-
ed. Then the symptoms usually disappear.
If taken too close to bedtime, caffeine can interfere
with sleep. Even if it does not prevent a person from
falling asleep, it may disturb sleep during the night.
The notion that caffeine helps people sober up after
drinking too much alcohol is a myth. In fact, using caf-
feine and alcohol together is not a good idea. The combi-
nation can lead to an upset stomach, nausea, and vomiting.
Older people may be more sensitive to caffeine and
thus more likely to have certain side effects, such as irri-
tability, nervousness, anxiety, and sleep problems.

Exercise is useful in preventing or treating coronary
heart disease, osteoporosis, weakness, diabetes, obesity,
and depression. Range of motion is one aspect of exercise
important for increasing or maintaining joint function.
Strengthening exercises provide appropriate resistance to
the muscles to increase endurance and strength. Cardiac
rehabilitation exercises are developed and individualized
to improve the cardiovascular system for prevention and
rehabilitation of cardiac disorders and diseases. A well-
balanced exercise program can improve general health,
build endurance, and delay many of the effects of aging.
The benefits of exercise not only improve physical health,
but also enhance emotional well-being.

The sweat test is both the easiest and most accurate
test for CF. In this test, a small amount of the drug pilo-
carpine is placed on the skin. A very small electrical cur-
rent is then applied to the area, which drives the pilo-
carpine into the skin. The drug stimulates sweating in the
treated area. The sweat is absorbed onto a piece of filter
paper, and is then analyzed for its salt content. A person
with CF will have salt concentrations that are one-and-
one-half to two times greater than normal. The test can
be done on persons of any age, including newborns, and
its results can be determined within an hour. Virtually
every person who has CF will test positively on it, and
virtually everyone who does not will test negatively.

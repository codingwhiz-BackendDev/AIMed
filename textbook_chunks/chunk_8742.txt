Depersonalization disorder is a disturbance in
which the patient’s primary symptom is a sense of
detachment from the self. Depersonalization as a symp-
tom (not as a disorder) is quite common in college-age
populations. It is often associated with sleep deprivation
or “recreational” drug use. It may be accompanied by
“derealization” (where objects in an environment appear
altered). Patients sometimes describe depersonalization
as feeling like a robot or watching themselves from the
outside. Depersonalization disorder may also involve
feelings of numbness or loss of emotional “aliveness.”
Dissociative identity disorder (DID)
Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is the newer
name for multiple personality disorder (MPD). DID is
considered the most severe dissociative disorder and
involves all of the major dissociative symptoms.
Dissociative disorder not otherwise specified
(DDNOS)
DDNOS is a diagnostic category ascribed to patients
with dissociative symptoms that do not meet the full cri-
teria for a specific dissociative disorder.

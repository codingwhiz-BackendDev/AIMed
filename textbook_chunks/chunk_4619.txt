Achromatopsia—The inability to distinguish any
colors.
Cones—Receptor cells that allow the perception
of colors.
Deuteranopia—The inability or difficulty in distin-
guishing red/green colors.
Photophobia—An extreme sensitivity to light.
Protanopia—The inability of difficulty in distin-
guishing blue and yellow colors.
Retina—The light-sensitive layer of tissue in the
back of the eye that receives and transmits visual
signals to the brain through the optic nerve.
Rod—Photoreceptor that is highly sensitive to low
levels of light and transmits images in shades of gray.
number that is clearly located somewhere in the center of
a circle of variously colored dots. A color-blind person is
not able to distinguish the number.
The Ishihara test is comprised of eight plates that are
similar to the American Optical Pseudoisochromatic test
plates. The individual being tested looks for numbers
among the various colored dots on each test plate. Some
plates distinguish between red/green and blue color
blindness. Individuals with normal color vision perceive
one number. Those with red/green color deficiency see a
different number. Those with blue color vision see yet a
different number.
A third analytical tool is the Titmus II Vision Tester
Color Perception test. The subject looks into a stereo-
scopic machine. The test stimulus most often used in
professional offices contains six different designs or
numbers on a black background, framed in a yellow bor-
der. Titmus II can test one eye at a time. However, its
value is limited because it can only identify red/green
deficiencies and is not highly accurate.

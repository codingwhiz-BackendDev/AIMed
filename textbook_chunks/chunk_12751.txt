It is illegal to perform FGM in many countries,
including the United States, Canada, France, Great
Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Egypt, Kenya, and Sene-
gal. This procedure is usually done in the home or some-
where other than a medical setting. Often, it is performed
by a family member or by a local “circumciser,” using
knives, razor blades, or other tools that may not be steril-
ized before use.

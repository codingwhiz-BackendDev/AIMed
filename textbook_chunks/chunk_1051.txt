Canker sores occur on the inside of the mouth, usu-
ally on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and/or soft palate.
They can also occur on the tongue and in the throat.
Often, several canker sores will appear at the same time
and may be grouped in clusters. Canker sores appear as a
whitish, round area with a red border. The sores are
painful and sensitive to touch. The average canker sore is
about one-quarter inch in size, although they can occa-
sionally be larger. Canker sores are not infectious.
Approximately 20% of the U.S. population is affect-
ed with recurring canker sores, and more women than
men get them. Women are more likely to have canker
sores during their premenstrual period.
Canker sores are sometimes confused with cold
sores. Cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus.
This disease, also known as oral herpes or fever blisters,
can occur anywhere on the body. Most commonly, her-
pes infection occurs on the outside of the lips and the
gums, and much less frequently on the inside the mouth.
Cold sores are infectious.

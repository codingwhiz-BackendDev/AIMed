Shortly after birth most infants loose some weight.
After that expected loss, babies should gain weight at a
steady and predictable rate. When a baby does not gain
weigh as expected, or continues to loose weight, it is not
thriving. Failure to thrive may be due to one or more
conditions.
Organic failure to thrive (OFTT) implies that the
organs involved with digestion and absorption of food
are malformed or incomplete so the baby cannot digest
its food. Non-organic failure to thrive (NOFTT) is the
most common cause of FTT and implies the baby is not
receiving enough food due to economic factors or
parental neglect, or do to psychosocial problems.

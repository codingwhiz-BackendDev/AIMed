CMV is an extremely common organism worldwide.
It is believed that about 85% of the adult population in the
United States have been infected by CMV at some point
in their lives. CMV is found in almost all of the bodyâ€™s
organs. It is also found in body fluids, including semen,
saliva, urine, feces, breast milk, blood, and secretions of
the cervix (the narrow, lower section of the uterus).
CMV is also able to cross the placenta (the organ
that provides oxygen and nutrients to the unborn baby in
the uterus). Because CMV can cross the placental barri-
er, initial infection in a pregnant woman can lead to
infection of the developing baby.

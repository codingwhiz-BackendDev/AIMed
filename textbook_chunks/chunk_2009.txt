Fixed contractures are usually treated with either
serial casting or surgery. The most commonly used surgi-
cal procedures are tenotomy, tendon transfer, and dorsal
rhizotomy. In tenotomy, tendons of the affected muscle
are cut and the limb is cast in a more normal position
while the tendon regrows. Alternatively, tendon transfer
involves cutting and reattaching a tendon at a different
point on the bone to enhance the length and function of
the muscle. A neurosurgeon performing dorsal rhizotomy
carefully cuts selected nerve roots in the spinal cord to
prevent them from stimulating the spastic muscles. Neu-
rosurgical techniques in the brain such as implanting tiny
electrodes directly into the cerebellum, or cutting a por-
tion of the hypothalamus, have very specific uses and
have had mixed results.

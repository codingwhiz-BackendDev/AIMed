Several common medications can impair the body’s
use of insulin, causing a condition known as secondary
diabetes. These medications include treatments for high
blood pressure (furosemide, clonidine, and thiazide
diuretics), drugs with hormonal activity (oral contra-
ceptives, thyroid hormone, progestins, and glucocorti-
corids), and the anti-inflammation drug indomethacin.
Several drugs that are used to treat mood disorders
(such as anxiety and depression) can also impair glucose
absorption. These drugs include haloperidol, lithium car-
bonate, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and
adrenergic agonists. Other medications that can cause
diabetes symptoms include isoniazid, nicotinic acid,
cimetidine, and heparin.

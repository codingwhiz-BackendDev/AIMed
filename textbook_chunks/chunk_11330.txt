With any pregnancy, whether it results in a live birth,
miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion, blood typing is a
universal precaution against blood compatibility disease.
Blood types cannot be changed, but adequate forewarn-
ing allows precautions and treatments that limit the dan-
ger to unborn babies.
If an Rh-negative woman gives birth to an Rh-posi-
tive baby, she is given an injection of immunoglobulin G,
a type of antibody protein, within 72 hours of the birth.
The immunoglobulin destroys any fetal blood cells in her
bloodstream before her immune system can react to
them. In cases where this precaution is not taken, anti-
bodies are created and future pregnancies may be com-
plicated.

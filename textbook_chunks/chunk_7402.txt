Pulmonary embolism —An obstruction of a blood
vessel in the lungs, usually caused by a blood clot
that blocks a coronary artery. Pulmonary embolism
can be very serious and, in some cases, fatal.
Thrombosis—The development of a blood clot
inside a blood vessel.
Doppler ultrasonography is usually the preferred
procedure for detecting deep vein thrombosis. This tech-
nique uses sound waves to measure blood flow through
leg veins and arteries. A blood pressure cuff is wrapped
around the patient’s ankle and a transducer with gel on it
is placed over pulse points of the foot and lower leg.
High-frequency sounds bounce off the soft tissue, and
the echoes are converted into images on a monitor. It is
very accurate in detecting clots above the knee that can
become pulmonary embolisms. Usually performed in a
physician’s office or hospital outpatient diagnostic cen-
ter, Doppler ultrasound usually takes 30–45 minutes.
Impedance plethysmography records changes in
blood volume and vessel resistance. A blood pressure
cuff is wrapped around the leg above the knee, four elec-
trodes are placed near the knee and the ankle, and the
cuff is inflated. How efficiently the veins return to nor-
mal is measured. Performed in a physician’s office, it
takes about 15 minutes.

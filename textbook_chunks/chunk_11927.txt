• iridocyclectomy-removal of parts of the ciliary body
and parts of iris,

In eye cancer where the tumor is small and there is a
good chance that the vision will be restored less drastic
measures than the above surgeries are taken. Radiation
and chemotherapy are two courses of treatment that
help in killing off the existing tumor and preventing its
spread into other areas of the body.
Besides radiation and chemotherapy there are other
methods of treating eye cancer. Cryotherapy uses
extreme cold to destroy the cancer cells. Thermotherapy
uses heat to destroy the cancer cells. Photocoagulation
uses a laser to destroy blood vessels that supply the tumor
with nutrients. If the tumor isn’t advanced these are good
options to treat it in order to avoid losing an eye.
A radiation/surgical treatment for eye cancer is
brachytherapy. A small plaque with radioactive iodine on
one side and gold on the other is stitched to the eye
behind the tumor with the radioactive iodine facing the
tumor. The gold is used to shield the other tissues from
the radiation. It is left there for a period of time depend-
ing on the dosage of radiation needed and then it is
removed. In this way the tumor is treated and hopefully
will shrink and eventually die.

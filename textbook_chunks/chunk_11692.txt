for overloading and strengthening muscles without any
special equipment and with little chance of injury.
ISOTONIC EXERCISE. Isotonic exercise differs from
isometric exercise in that there is movement of a joint
during the muscle contraction. A classic example of an
isotonic exercise is weight training with dumbbells and
barbells. As the weight is lifted throughout the range of
motion, the muscle shortens and lengthens. Calisthenics
are also an example of isotonic exercise. These would
include chin-ups, push-ups, and sit-ups, all of which use
body weight as the resistance force.
ISOKINETIC EXERCISE. Isokinetic exercise utilizes
machines that control the speed of contraction within the
range of motion. Isokinetic exercise attempts to combine
the best features of both isometrics and weight training.
It provides muscular overload at a constant preset speed
while a muscle mobilizes its force through the full range
of motion. For example, an isokinetic stationary bicycle
set at 90 revolutions per minute means that despite how
hard and fast the exerciser works, the isokinetic proper-
ties of the bicycle will allow the exerciser to pedal only
as fast as 90 revolutions per minute. Machines known as
Cybex and Biodex provide isokinetic results; they are
generally used by physical therapists and are not readily
available to the general population.

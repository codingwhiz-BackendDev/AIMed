Joint mobilization and stretching of soft tissues is a
common technique used to increase joint elasticity.
Structures are stretched in similar directions to those
which take place upon normal joint motion. Some
healthcare professionals may use some form of heat prior
to the stretching and mobilization. If appropriate, exer-
cise may follow manual techniques to help maintain the
additional motion achieved.

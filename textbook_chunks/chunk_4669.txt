• Death (necrosis) of stomal tissue. Caused by inade-
quate blood supply, this complication is usually visible
12–24 hours after the operation and may require addi-
tional surgery.
• Retraction (stoma is flush with the abdomen surface or
has moved below it). Caused by insufficient stomal
length, this complication may be managed by use of
special pouching supplies. Elective revision of the
stoma is also an option.
• Prolapse (stoma increases length above the surface of
the abdomen). Most often results from an overly large
opening in the abdominal wall or inadequate fixation of
the bowel to the abdominal wall. Surgical correction is
required when blood supply is compromised.
• Stenosis (narrowing at the opening of the stoma). Often
associated with infection around the stoma or scarring.
Mild stenosis can be removed under local anesthesia.

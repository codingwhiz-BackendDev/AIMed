A fracture usually results from traumatic injury to
bones causing the continuity of bone tissues or bony carti-
lage to be disrupted or broken. Fracture classifications
include simple, compound, incomplete and complete.
Simple fractures (more recently called “closed”) are not
obvious as the skin has not been ruptured and remains
intact. Compound fractures (now commonly called
“open”) break the skin, exposing bone and causing addi-
tional soft tissue injury and possible infection. A single
fracture means that one fracture only has occurred and
multiple fractures refer to more than one fracture occur-
ring in the same bone. Fractures are termed complete if
the break is completely through the bone and described as
incomplete or “greenstick” if the fracture occurs partly
across a bone shaft. This latter type of fracture is often the
result of bending or crushing forces applied to a bone.
Fractures are also named according to the specific
part of the bone involved and the nature of the break.
Identification of a fracture line can further classify frac-
tures. Types include linear, oblique, transverse, longitu-
dinal, and spiral fractures. Fractures can be further subdi-
vided by the positions of bony fragments and are
described as comminuted, non-displaced, impacted,
overriding, angulated, displaced, avulsed, and segmental.
Additionally, an injury may be classified as a fracture-
dislocation when a fracture involves the bony structures
of any joint with associated dislocation of the same joint.

The identified patient (IP) is the family member with
the symptom that has brought the family into treatment.
The concept of the IP is used by family therapists to keep
the family from scapegoating the IP or using him or her
as a way of avoiding problems in the rest of the system.
Homeostasis (balance)
The concept of homeostasis means that the family
system seeks to maintain its customary organization and
functioning over time. It tends to resist change. The fami-
ly therapist can use the concept of homeostasis to explain
why a certain family symptom has surfaced at a given
time, why a specific member has become the IP, and what
is likely to happen when the family begins to change.

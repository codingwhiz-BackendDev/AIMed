Most patients who undergo evaluation for FUO do not
receive treatment until a clear-cut cause is found. Antibi-
otics or medications designed to suppress a fever (such as
NSAIDs) will only hide the true cause. Once physicians are
satisfied that there is no infectious cause, they may use med-
ications such as NSAIDs, or corticosteroids to decrease
inflammation and diminish constitutional symptoms.
The development of FUO in certain settings, such as
that acquired by patients in the hospital or in those with a
low white blood count, often needs rapid treatment to
avoid serious complications. Therefore, in these instances
patients may be placed on antibiotics after a minimal
number of diagnostic studies. Once test results are
known, treatment can be adjusted as needed.

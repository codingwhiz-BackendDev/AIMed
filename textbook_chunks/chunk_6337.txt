There is no cure for CJD, and no treatment that
slows the progression of the disease. Drug therapy and
nursing care are aimed at minimizing psychiatric symp-
toms and increasing patient comfort. However, the rapid
progression of CJD frustrates most attempts at treatment,
since decreasing cognitive function and more prominent
behavioral symptoms develop so quickly. Despite the
generally grim prognosis, a few CJD patients progress
more slowly and live longer than the average; for these
patients, treatment will be more satisfactory. Scientists
are investigating whether some medicines that can
“break” the abnormal protein form may be useful and
whether a vaccine could help.

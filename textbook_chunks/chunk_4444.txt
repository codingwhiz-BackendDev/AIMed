During a colicky episode, babies’ bellies often look
swollen, feel hard, and make a rumbling sound. Crying
intensifies, tapers off, then gets louder. Many babies
grow rigid, clench their fists, curl their toes, and draw
their legs toward their body. A burp or a bowel move-
ment can end an attack. Most babies who have colic
don’t seem to be in pain between attacks.

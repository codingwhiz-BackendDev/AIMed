The major risk factors for cancer are: tobacco, alco-
hol, diet, sexual and reproductive behavior, infectious
agents, family history, occupation, environment and pol-
lution.
According to the estimates of the American Cancer
Society (ACS), approximately 40% of the cancer deaths
in 1998 will be due to tobacco and excessive alcohol use.
An additional one-third of the deaths will be related to
diet and nutrition. Many of the one million skin cancers
that are expected to be diagnosed in 1998 will be due to
over-exposure to ultraviolet light from the sunâ€™s rays.

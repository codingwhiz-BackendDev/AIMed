In order to treat the disease, either mebendazole
(Vermox) or pyrantel pamoate (Pin-X) will be given in
two oral doses spaced two weeks apart. These medica-
tions eradicate the infection in approximately 90% of
cases. Re-infection is common and several treatments
may be required. Because the infection is easily spread
through contact with contaminated clothing or surfaces,
it is recommended that all family members receive the
therapeutic dose. Sometimes a series of six treatments
are given, each spaced two weeks apart. If family mem-
bers continue to be infected, a source outside the house
may be responsible.
To relieve the rectal itching, a shallow warm bath
with either half a cup of table salt, or Epsom salts is rec-
ommended. Also, application of an ointment containing
zinc oxide or regular petroleum jelly can be used to
relieve rectal itching.

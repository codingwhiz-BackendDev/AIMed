Filiariasis is the name for a group of tropical dis-
eases caused by various thread-like parasitic round
worms (nematodes) and their larvae. The larvae transmit
the disease to humans through a mosquito bite. Filariasis
is characterized by fever, chills, headache, and skin
lesions in the early stages and, if untreated, can progress
to include gross enlargement of the limbs and genitalia in
a condition called elephantiasis.

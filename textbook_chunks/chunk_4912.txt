The precise differences in density allowed by CT scan
can clearly show tumors, strokes, or lesions in the brain area
as altered densities. These lighter or darker areas on the
image may indicate a tumor or hematoma within the brain
and skull area. Different types of tumors can be identified
by the presence of edema, by the tissueâ€™s density, or by
studying blood vessel location and activity. The speed and
convenience of CT often allows for detection of hemorrhage
before symptoms even occur. Congenital abnormalities in
children, such as hydrocephalus, may also be confirmed
with CT. Hydrocephalus is suggested by enlargement of the
fluid structures called ventricles of the brain.

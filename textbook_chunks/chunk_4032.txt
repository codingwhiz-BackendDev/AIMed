Experts do not agree on the precise cause of club-
foot. The exact genetic mechanism of inheritance has
been extensively investigated using family studies and
other epidemiological methods. As of 1999, no definitive
conclusions had been reached, although a Mendelian pat-
tern of inheritance is suspected. This may be due to the
interaction of several different inheritance patterns, dif-
ferent patterns of development appearing as the same
condition, or a complex interaction between genetic and
environmental factors. The MSX1 gene has been associ-
ated with clubfoot in animal studies. But, as of 2001,
these findings have not been replicated in humans.
A family history of clubfoot has been reported in
24.4% of families in a single study. These findings sug-
gest the potential role of one or more genes being respon-
sible for clubfoot.
Several environmental causes have been proposed
for clubfoot. Obstetricians feel that intrauterine crowd-
ing causes clubfoot. This theory is supported by a sig-
nificantly higher incidence of clubfoot among twins
compared to singleton births. Intrauterine exposure to
the drug misoprostol has been linked with clubfoot.
Misoprostol is commonly used when trying, usually
unsuccessfully, to induce abortion in Brazil and in
other countries in South and Central America.
Researchers in Norway have reported that males who
are in the printing trades have significantly more off-
spring with clubfoot than men in other occupations.
For unknown reasons, amniocentesis, a prenatal test,
has also been associated with clubfoot. The infants of
mothers who smoke during pregnancy have a greater
chance of being born with clubfoot than are offspring
of women who do not smoke.
True clubfoot is usually obvious at birth. The four
most common varieties have been described. A clubfoot
has a typical appearance of pointing downward and

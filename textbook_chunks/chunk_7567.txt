The symptoms of delirium come on quickly, in
hours or days, in contrast to those of dementia, which
develop much more slowly. Delirium symptoms typically
fluctuate through the day, with periods of relative calm
and lucidity alternating with periods of florid delirium.
The hallmark of delirium is a fluctuating level of con-
sciousness. Symptoms may include:
• decreased awareness of the environment
• confusion or disorientation, especially of time
• memory impairment, especially of recent events
• hallucinations
• illusions and misinterpreted stimuli
• increased or decreased activity level

While the cystoscopy procedure is commonly relied
upon to gather additional diagnostic information, it is an
invasive surgical technique that may involve risks for certain
patients. Those who are extremely overweight (obese),
smoke, are recovering from a recent illness, or are treating a
chronic condition may face additional risks from surgery.
Surgical risk also increases in patients who are cur-
rently using certain drugs including antihypertensives;
muscle relaxants; tranquilizers; sleep inducers; insulin;
sedatives; beta blockers; or cortisone. Those who use
mind-altering drugs also put themselves at increased risk of
complications during surgery. The following mind-altering
drugs should be avoided: narcotics; psychedelics; hallu-
cinogens; marijuana; sedatives; hypnotics; or cocaine.

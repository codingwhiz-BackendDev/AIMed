Surgery for the purpose of tumor removal, biopsy, or
size reduction is associated with postoperative pain and
local nerve damage, which may be both severe and difficult
to alleviate. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can also
produce nerve damage and severe pain. Additionally,
patients with malignant cancer are susceptible to infections
like herpes, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and
wound abscess, all of which can cause severe pain. Pain
associated with cancer and/or treatments can significantly
impair the patient’s capabilities for performing daily tasks
and hence impair quality of life. These complications may
negatively impact the patient’s psychological well being.

• Sinus studies. The CT scan can show details of sinusi-
tis and bone fractures. Physicians may order a CT of
the sinuses to provide an accurate map for surgery.
• Brain studies. Brain scans can detect hematomas,
tumors, and strokes. The introduction of CT scanning,
especially spiral CT, has helped reduce the need for more
invasive procedures such as cerebral angiography.
• Body scans. CT scans of the body will often be used
to observe abdominal organs, such as the liver, kid-
neys, adrenal glands, spleen, and lymph nodes, and
extremities.
• Aorta scans. CT scans can focus on the thoracic or
abdominal aorta to locate aneurysms and other possible
aortic diseases.
• Chest scans. CT scans of the chest are useful in distin-
guishing tumors and in detailing accumulation of fluid
in chest infections.

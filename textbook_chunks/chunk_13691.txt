36â€“72 hours after eating contaminated food. These symp-
toms are slightly different from those associated with most
foodborne bacteria. In addition to the familiar watery diar-
rhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, chills and fever
occur. The diarrhea may be quite severe with cramps pro-
gressing to classical dysentery. Up to 40% of children with
severe infections show neurological symptoms. These
include seizures caused by fever, confusion, headache,
lethargy, and a stiff neck that resembles meningitis.
The disease runs its course usually in two to three
days but may last longer. Dehydration is a common com-
plication. Most people recover on their own, although
they may feel exhausted, but children who are malnour-
ished or have weakened immune systems may die.
Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum)
C. botulinum, which causes both adult botulism and
infant botulism, is unlike any of the other foodborne bac-
teria. First, C. botulinum is an anaerobic bacterium in
that it can only live in the absence of oxygen. Second, the
toxins from C. botulinum are neurotoxins. They poison
the nervous system, causing paralysis without the vomit-
ing and diarrhea associated with other foodborne illness-
es. Third, toxins that cause adult botulism are released
when the bacteria grows in an airless environment out-
side the body. They can be broken down and made harm-

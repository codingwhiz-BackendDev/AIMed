Deep vein thrombosis is a common but difficult to
detect illness that can be fatal if not treated effectively.
According to the American Heart Association, more than
two million Americans develop deep vein thrombosis
annually. An estimated 600,000 of these develop pul-
monary embolism, a potentially fatal complication
where the blood clots break off and form pulmonary
emboli, plugs that block the lung arteries. Sixty thousand
people die of pulmonary embolism each year. Deep vein
thrombosis is also called venous thromboembolism,
thrombophlebitis or phlebothrombosis.
Deep vein thrombosis is a major complication in
patients who have had orthopedic surgery or pelvic,
abdominal, or thoracic surgery. Patients with cancer
and other chronic illnesses (including congestive heart
failure), as well as those who have suffered a recent
myocardial infarction, are also at high risk for develop-
ing DVT. Deep vein thrombosis can be chronic, with
recurrent episodes.

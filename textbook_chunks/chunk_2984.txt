Fetal monitoring is a process in which the baby’s
heart rate is monitored for indicators of stress during labor
and birth. There are several types of fetal monitoring.
A special stethoscope called a fetoscope may be
used. This is a simple and non-invasive method.
The Doppler method uses ultrasound; it involves a
handheld listening device that transmits the sounds of the
heart rate through a speaker or into an attached ear piece.
It can usually pick up the heart sounds 12 weeks after
conception. This method offers intermittent monitoring.
It allows the mother freedom to move about and is also
useful during contractions.
Electronic fetal monitoring uses ultrasound and
provides a view of the heartbeat in relationship to the
mother’s contractions. It can be used either continuously
or intermittently. It is often used in high risk pregnan-
cies, and is not often recommended for low risk ones

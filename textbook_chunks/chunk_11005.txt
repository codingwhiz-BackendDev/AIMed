People with allergies to beef, pork, pineapples, and
papaya may suffer allergic reactions to enzyme supple-
ments. Tablets are often coated to prevent them from
breaking down in the stomach, and usually shouldnâ€™t be
chewed or crushed. People who have difficulty swallow-
ing pills can request enzyme supplements in capsule
form. The capsules can then be opened and the contents
sprinkled onto soft foods like applesauce.

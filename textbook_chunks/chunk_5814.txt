Corns and calluses can usually be prevented by avoid-
ing friction-causing activities and wearing shoes that fit
properly, are activity-appropriate, and are kept in good
repair. Soles and heels that wear unevenly may indicate a
need for corrective footwear or special insoles. Socks and
stockings should not cramp the toes. Gloves, kneepads,
and other protective gear should also be worn as needed.
Feet should be measured, while standing, whenever
buying new shoes. It is best to shop for shoes late in the
day, when feet are likely to be swollen. It is also impor-
tant to buy shoes with toe-wiggling room and to try new
shoes on both feet.

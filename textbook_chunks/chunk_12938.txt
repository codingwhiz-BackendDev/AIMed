AIDS—Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is
often represented by these initials. The disease is
associated with infection by the human immunod-
eficiency virus (HIV), and has the main feature of
repeated infections, due to failure of certain parts
of the immune system. Infection by HIV damages
part of the body’s natural immunity, and leads to
recurrent illnesses.
Antibiotic—A medication that is designed to kill
or weaken bacteria.
Computed tomography scan (CT Scan)—A spe-
cialized x-ray procedure in which cross-sections
of the area in question can be examined in detail.
This allows physicians to examine organs such as
the pancreas, bile ducts, and others which are
often the site of hidden infections.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)—This is a
new technique similar to CT Scan, but based on
the magnetic properties of various areas of the
body to compose images.
NSAID—Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
are medications such as aspirin and ibuprofen that
decrease pain and inflammation. Many can now
be obtained without a doctor’s prescription.
Ultrasound—A non-invasive procedure based on
changes in sound waves of a frequency that can-
not be heard, but respond to changes in tissue
composition. It is very useful for diagnosing dis-
eases of the gallbladder, liver, and hidden infec-
tions, such as abscesses.

Certain drugs interfere with the breakdown of caf-
feine in the body. These include oral contraceptives that
contain estrogen, the antiarrhythmia drug mexiletine
(Mexitil), the ulcer drug cimetidine (Tagamet), and the
drug disulfiram (Antabuse), used to treat alcoholism.
Caffeine interferes with drugs that regulate heart
rhythm, such as quinidine and propranolol (Inderal). Caf-
feine may also interfere with the body’s absorption of iron.
Anyone who takes iron supplements should take them at
least an hour before or two hours after using caffeine.
Serious side effects are possible when caffeine is
combined with certain drugs. For example, taking caf-
feine with the decongestant phenylpropanolamine can
raise blood pressure. And very serious heart problems
may occur if caffeine and monoamine oxidase
inhibitors (MAO) are taken together. These drugs are
used to treat Parkinson’s disease, depression, and other
psychiatric conditions. Consult with a pharmacist or
physician about which drugs can interact with caffeine.
Because caffeine stimulates the nervous system,
anyone taking other central nervous system (CNS) stim-
ulants should be careful about using caffeine.

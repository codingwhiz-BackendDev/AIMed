Excess sodium can increase the risk of high blood
pressure. Many processed foods contain large amounts of
sodium. Limit daily intake to about 2,400 milligrams,
about the amount in a teaspoon of salt.
The “Food Guide” Pyramid developed by the U.S.
Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Ser-
vices provides easy-to-follow guidelines for daily heart-
healthy eating. It recommends six to 11 servings of bread,
cereal, rice, and pasta; three to five servings of vegetables;
two to four servings of fruit; two to three servings of milk,
yogurt, and cheese; and two to three servings of meat,
poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts. Fats, oils, and
sweets should be used sparingly. Canola and olive oil are
better for the heart than other cooking oils. Coronary
patients should be on a strict diet.

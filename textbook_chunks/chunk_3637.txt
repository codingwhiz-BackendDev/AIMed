It is generally recommended that women undergoing
chorionic villus sampling have someone drive them
home and have no plans for the rest of the day. Women
with Rh negative blood must receive a Rho (D) immune
globulin injection following the procedure. Women
should call their doctor if they experience excessive
bleeding, vaginal discharge, fever, or abdominal pain
after the procedure.

Electrolyte tests are typically conducted on blood
plasma or serum, urine, and diarrheal fluids. Electrolytes
can be classified in at least five different ways. One way
is that some electrolytes tend to exist mostly inside cells,
or are intracellular, while others tend to be outside cells,
or are extracellular. Potassium, phosphate, and magne-
sium occur at much greater levels inside the cell than
outside, while sodium and chloride occur at much greater
levels extracellularly. A second classification distinguish-
es those electrolytes that participate directly in the trans-
mission of nerve impulses and those that do not. Sodium,
potassium, and calcium are the important electrolytes
involved in nerve impulses, and disorders affecting them
are most closely associated with neurological disorders.
A third classification focuses on electrolytes that are able
to form a tight union, or complex, with one another. Cal-
cium and phosphate have the greatest tendency to form
complexes with each other. Disorders that cause an
increase in either plasma calcium or phosphate can result
in the deposit of calcium-phosphate crystals in the soft
tissues of the body. A fourth classification concerns those
electrolytes that influence the acidity or alkalinity of the
bloodstream, also known as the pH. The pH of the blood-
stream is normally in the range of 7.35â€“7.45. A decrease
below this range is called acidosis, while a pH above this
range is called alkalosis. The electrolytes most closely
associated with the pH of the bloodstream are bicarbon-
ate, chloride, and phosphate.

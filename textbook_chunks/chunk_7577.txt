Persons with delirium usually have a worse prog-
nosis for the underlying disease than the person with-
out delirium. Nonetheless, those without terminal ill-
ness usually recover from delirium. They may not,
however, regain all their original cognitive abilities,
and may be left with some permanent impairments,
including fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating,
or mood changes.

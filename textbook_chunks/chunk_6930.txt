Some states now require screening of newborns for
CF, using a test known as the IRT test. This is a blood test
which measures the level of immunoreactive trypsino-
gen, which is generally higher in babies with CF than
those without it. This test gives many false positive
results immediately after birth, and so requires a second
test several weeks later. A second positive result is usual-
ly followed by a sweat test.

Because the fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis
is airborne and microscopic, the only method of preven-
tion is to avoid visiting areas where it is found in the soil.
Unfortunately, for many people this is impractical. Main-
taining general good health and avoiding HIV infection
will limit coccidioidomycosis to the acute and relatively
mild form in most people.

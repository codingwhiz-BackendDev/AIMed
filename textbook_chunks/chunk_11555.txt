This procedure involves measuring the esophagus’
exposure to acid that has “refluxed” from the stomach.
The test is ideal for evaluating recurring heartburn or
GERD. Too much acid produces not only heartburn, but
also ulcers that can bleed or produce areas of narrowing
(strictures) when they heal.
Normally, acid refluxes into the esophagus in only
small amounts for short periods of time. A muscle called
the lower esophageal sphincter prevents excessive reflux.
Spontaneous contractions that increase esophageal emp-
tying and production of saliva are other important protec-
tive mechanisms.
“pH” is the scientific term that tells just how acidic or
alkaline a substance is. Researchers have shown that in the
esophagus, the presence of acid is damaging only if it per-
sists for prolonged periods. Therefore, the test has been
designed to monitor the level of acidity over 24 hours, usu-
ally in the home. In this way, patients maintain their daily
routine, documenting their symptoms, and at what point in
their activities they occurred. During this period, a thin
tube with a pH monitor remains in the esophagus to record
changes. After the study, a computer is used to compare
changes in acidity with symptoms reported by the patient.
Surgery is an effective and long-lasting treatment for
symptoms of recurrent reflux and is the choice of many
patients and doctors. pH monitoring is usually performed
before surgery to confirm the diagnosis and to judge the
effects of drug therapy.

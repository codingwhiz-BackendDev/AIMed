These tests are more often performed in a consulting
laboratory than at a physician’s office or in a hospital
laboratory. Like most antibody tests, they are performed
on serum, the liquid part of the blood obtained after the
whole blood is allowed to clot in a tube. Antibodies can
be detected against several components of the Epstein-
Barr virus (EBV). These components are the EBV early
antigen (EA), the viral capsid antigen (VCA), and the
nuclear antigen (EBNA). These several antigens are dif-
ferent proteins that are produced in the process (stages)
of the virus’ growth.
At the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus,
antibodies to EA are found and usually last for four to six
months only. This antibody, however, persists substan-
tially longer in about 10% of persons who have had EBV
infection in the more remote past. The absence of anti-
body to EA when other EBV antibodies are present
strongly suggests that first time infection with EBV
occurred in the past.
Antibody to VCA is found both early and late in
EBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody of
both the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four to
six months, usually, only the IgG antibody against VCA
can be found.
Unlike antibodies to EA and VCA, antibody to
EBNA does not usually develop until recovery from first
time infection of this virus. Therefore, finding detectable
amounts of antibody to EBNA during an illness which
might be caused by EBV makes the causal relationship
very unlikely.

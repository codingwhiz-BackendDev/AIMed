The gradual progression of cervical spondylosis
cannot be stopped; however, it doesn’t always cause
symptoms. For the individuals who do experience prob-
lems, conservative treatment is very effective in manag-
ing the symptoms. Nearly all people with neck pain,
approximately 75% of persons with radiculopathy, and
up to 50% of people with myelopathy find relief through
therapy alone. For the remaining people with radiculopa-
thy or myelopathy, surgery may be recommended.
Surgery is deemed successful in 70–80% of cases.

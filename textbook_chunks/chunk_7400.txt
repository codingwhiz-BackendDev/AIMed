Deep vein thrombosis can be detected through
venography and radionuclide venography, Doppler
ultrasonography, and impedance plethysmography.
Venography is the most accurate test, but it is not used
much, because it is often painful, expensive, exposes
the patient to radiation, and can cause reactions and
complications. Venography identifies the location,
extent, and degree of attachment of the blood clots, and
enables the condition of the deep leg veins to be
assessed. A contrast solution is injected into a foot vein
through a catheter. The physician observes the move-
ment of the solution through the vein with a fluoro-
scope while a series of x rays are taken. Venography
takes 30–45 minutes and can be done in a physician’s
office, a laboratory, or a hospital. Radionuclide venog-
raphy, in which a radioactive isotope is injected, is
occasionally used, especially if a patient has had reac-
tions to contrast solutions.

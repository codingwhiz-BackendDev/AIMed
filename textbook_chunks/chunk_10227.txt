Emboli have moved from the place where they were
formed through the bloodstream to another part of the
body, where they obstruct an artery and block the flow of
blood. The emboli are usually formed from blood clots
but are occasionally comprised of air, fat, or tumor tis-
sue. Embolic events can be multiple and small, or single
and massive. They can be life-threatening and require
immediate emergency medical care. There are three gen-
eral categories of emboli: arterial, gas, and pulmonary.
Pulmonary emboli are the most common.

Antibiotics are generally prescribed for rashes
caused by bacteria, particularly impetigo. This may be a
topical or oral formulation, depending on the size of the
area involved and the severity of the infection.
Over-the-counter antifungal creams, such as Lotrim-
in, are often recommended to treat a rash resulting from
yeast. If topical treatment is not effective, an oral antifun-
gal may be prescribed.
Mild steroid creams, such as 0.5â€“1% hydrocorti-
sone, can be used for seborrheic dermatitis and some-
times intertrigo. Prescription strength creams may be
needed for short-term treatment of more stubborn cases.

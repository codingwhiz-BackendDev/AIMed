The prognosis for uncomplicated dengue fever is
very good, and almost 100% of patients fully recover.
However, as many as 6â€“30% of all patients die when
DHF occurs. The death rate is especially high among the
youngest patients (under one year old). In places where
excellent medical care is available, very close monitoring
and immediate treatment of complications lowers the
death rate among DHF and DSS patients to about 1%.

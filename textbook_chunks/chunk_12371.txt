The major cause of death in many patients with FAP
remains colorectal cancer. One study suggested that even
with improved disease recognition, social and emotional
factors, such as fear of surgery, may significantly delay a
patientâ€™s treatment. In recent years, the trend is towards
mortality from other causes, such as desmoid tumors or
cancers other than colorectal. It has been estimated that a
patient with known FAP has a relative risk of dying over
three times greater than that of the average population, at
a given age.

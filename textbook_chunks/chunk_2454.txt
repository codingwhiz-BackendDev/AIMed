Activated charcoal’s most important use is for treat-
ment of poisoning. It helps prevent the absorption of
most poisons or drugs by the stomach and intestines. In
addition to being used for most swallowed poisons in
humans, charcoal has been effectively used in dogs, rab-
bits, rats, and other animals, as well. It can also adsorb
gas in the bowels and has been used for the treatment of
gas or diarrhea. Charcoal’s other uses such as treatment
of viruses, bacteria, bacterial toxic byproducts, snake
venoms and other substances by adsorption have not
been supported by clinical studies. By adding water to
the powder to make a paste, activated charcoal can be
used as an external application to alleviate pain and itch-
ing from bites and stings.

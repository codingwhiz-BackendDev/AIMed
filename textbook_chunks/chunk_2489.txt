CMT is named for the three neurologists who first
described the condition in the late 1800s. It is also known
as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, and is some-
times called peroneal muscular atrophy, referring to the
muscles in the leg that are often affected. The age of onset
of CMT can vary anywhere from young childhood to the
50s or 60s. Symptoms typically begin by the age of 20. For
reasons yet unknown, the severity in symptoms can also
vary greatly, even among members of the same family.
Although CMT has been described for many years,
it is only since the early 1990s that the genetic cause of
many of the types of CMT have become known. There-
fore, knowledge about CMT has increased dramatically
within a short time.

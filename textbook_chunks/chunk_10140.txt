If the baby’s heart rate drops very low or rises very
high, this signals a serious problem. In either of these
cases it is obvious that the baby is in distress and must be
delivered soon. However, many babies who are having
problems do not give such clear signs.
During a contraction, the flow of oxygen (from the
mother) through the placenta (to the baby) is temporarily
stopped. It is as if the baby has to hold its breath during
each contraction. Both the placenta and the baby are
designed to withstand this condition. Between contrac-
tions, the baby should be receiving more than enough
oxygen to do well during the contraction.
The first sign that a baby is not getting enough oxy-
gen between contractions is often a drop in the baby’s
heart rate after the contraction (late deceleration). The
baby’s heart rate recovers to a normal level between con-
tractions, only to drop again after the next contraction.
This is also a more subtle sign of distress.

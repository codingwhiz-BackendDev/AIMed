In cases of lymphatic filariasis, the most common
form of the disease, the disease is caused by the adult
worms actually living in the lymphatic vessels near the
lymph nodes where they distort the vessels and cause local
inflammation. In advanced stages, the worms can actually
obstruct the vessels, causing the surrounding tissue to
become enlarged. In Bancroftian filariasis, the legs and
genitals are most often involved, while the Malayan vari-
ety affects the legs below the knees. Repeated episodes of
inflammation lead to blockages of the lymphatic system,
especially in the genitals and legs. This causes the affected
area to become grossly enlarged, with thickened, coarse
skin, leading to a condition called elephantiasis.
In conjunctiva filariasis, the wormsâ€™ larvae migrate
to the eye and can sometimes be seen moving beneath
the skin or beneath the white part of the eye (conjuncti-
va). If untreated, this disease can cause a type of blind-
ness known as onchocerciasis.

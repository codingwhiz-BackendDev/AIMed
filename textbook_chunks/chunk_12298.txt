Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited
disorder of the inflammatory response characterized by
recurring attacks of fever, accompanied by intense pain
in the abdomen, chest, or joints. Attacks usually last
12â€“72 hours, and can occasionally involve a skin rash.
Kidney disease is a serious concern if the disorder is not
treated. FMF is most prevalent in people of Armenian,
Sephardic-Jewish, Arabic, and Turkish ancestry.

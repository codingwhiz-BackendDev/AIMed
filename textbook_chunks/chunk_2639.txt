Chemotherapy is usually given in addition to other
cancer treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy.
When given with other treatments, it is called adjuvant
chemotherapy. An oncologist decides which chemothera-
py drug or combination of drugs will work best for each
patient. The use of two or more drugs together often works
better than a single drug for treating cancer. This is called
combination chemotherapy. Scientific studies of different
drug combinations help doctors learn which combinations
work best for each type of cancer.

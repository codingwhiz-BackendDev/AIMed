Cerumen is most likely to become impacted when it
is pushed against the eardrum by cotton-tipped applica-
tors, hair pins, or other objects that people put in their
ears; and when it is trapped against the eardrum by a
hearing aid. Less common causes of cerumen impaction
include overproduction of earwax by the glands in the
ear canal, or an abnormally shaped ear canal.

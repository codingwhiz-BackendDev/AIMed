Carpal tunnel syndrome is initially treated with
splints, which support the wrist and prevent it from flex-
ing inward into the position which exacerbates median
nerve compression. Some people get significant relief by
wearing such splints to sleep at night, while others will
need to wear the splints all day, especially if they are per-
forming jobs which stress the wrist. Ibuprofen or other
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be pre-
scribed to decrease pain and swelling. When carpal tun-
nel syndrome is more advanced, injection of steroids into
the wrist to decrease inflammation may be necessary.
The most severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome
may require surgery to decrease the compression of the
median nerve and restore its normal function. Such a
repair involves cutting that ligament which crosses the
wrist, thus allowing the median nerve more room and
decreasing compression. This surgery is done almost
exclusively on an outpatient basis and is often performed
without the patient having to be made unconscious. Care-
ful injection of numbing medicines (local anesthesia) or
nerve blocks (the injection of anesthetics directly into the
nerve) create sufficient numbness to allow the surgery to
be performed painlessly, without the risks associated with
general anesthesia. Recovery from this type of surgery is
usually quick and without complications.

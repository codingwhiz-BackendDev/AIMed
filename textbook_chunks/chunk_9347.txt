The digestive problems may have an identifiable
cause, such as bacterial or viral infection, peptic ulcer,
gallbladder, or liver disease. The bacteria Helicobacter
pylori is often found in those individuals suffering from
duodenal or gastric ulcers. Investigation of recurrent
indigestion should rule out these possible causes.
Often, there is no organic cause for the problem, in
which case dyspepsia is classified as functional or nonul-
cer dyspepsia. There is evidence that functional dyspepsia
may be related to abnormal motility of the upper gastroin-
testinal tract (a state known as dysmotility in which the
esophagus, stomach, and upper intestine behave abnor-
mally). These patients may respond to a group of drugs
called prokinate agents. A review of eating habits (e.g.
chewing with the mouth open, gulping food, or talking
while chewing) may reveal a tendency to swallow air. This
may contribute to feeling bloated, or to excessive belching.
Smoking, caffeine, alcohol, or carbonated beverages may
contribute to the discomfort. When there is sensitivity or
allergy to certain food substances, eating those foods may
cause gastrointestinal distress. Some medications are asso-
ciated with indigestion. Stomach problems may also be a
response to stress or emotional unrest.

ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy, is usually
employed after all therapy and pharmaceutical treatment
options have been explored. However, it is sometimes used
early in treatment when severe depression is present and
the patient refuses oral medication, or when the patient is
becoming dehydrated, extremely suicidal, or psychotic.
The treatment consists of a series of electrical pulses
that move into the brain through electrodes on the
patientâ€™s head. ECT is given under general anesthesia
and patients are administered a muscle relaxant to pre-
vent convulsions. Although the exact mechanisms behind
the success of ECT therapy are not known, it is believed
that the electrical current modifies the electrochemical
processes of the brain, consequently relieving depres-
sion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confusion
are possible side effects immediately following an ECT
procedure. Memory loss, typically transient, has also
been reported in ECT patients.

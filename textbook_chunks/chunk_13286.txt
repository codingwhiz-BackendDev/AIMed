Like ciguatera, scombroid poisoning is diagnosed
based on typical symptoms occurring after eating fish.
There are usually no available tests for the patient.
Experimentally, however, elevated levels of histamine-
related products have been found in the urine. It may
be possible for public health officials to test any
remaining fish flesh for histamine levels. Improperly
refrigerated fish caught in both temperate and tropical
waters have been linked to the illness. An outbreak of
similar cases may be helpful in correctly diagnosing
the problem.

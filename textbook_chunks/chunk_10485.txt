If the endometrial biopsy is being done to investigate
why a woman is unable to get pregnant, the test must be
performed at a specific time during the menstrual cycle.
Since the test evaluates whether the endometrium is
developed adequately to support implantation and growth
of a fertilized egg, it is critical to perform the test approxi-
mately three days before the expected menstrual period.

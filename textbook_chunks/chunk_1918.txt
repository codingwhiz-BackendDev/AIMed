care. Antiplatelet agents and blood thinners should be dis-
continued and their effects reversed, if possible. Surgery
may be needed to remove brain hemorrhage, although
bleeding during surgery may be difficult to control.
CAA may be rarely associated with cerebral vasculitis,
or inflammation of the blood vessel walls. In these cases
treatment with steroids or immune system suppressants
may be helpful. Without tissue examination, vasculitis can-
not be diagnosed reliably, and probably coexists with CAA
too rarely to justify steroid treatment in most cases.

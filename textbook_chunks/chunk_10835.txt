The diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com-
plicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and other
types of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most cases
of mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organism
because the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups of
patients, however, should have stool tests. They include:
• patients with bloody diarrhea,
• patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy-
drated,
• patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than
three days without decreasing in amount,
• patients with disorders of the immune system.
The patient history is useful for public health reasons
as well as helping the doctor determine what type of
enterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctor
will ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar-
rhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient is
nauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to be
located in the small intestine. If the patient is running a
fever, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor
will also ask if anyone else in the patient’s family or
workplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae are
more likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Other
questions include the patient’s food intake over the last
few days and whether he or she has recently traveled to
countries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks.

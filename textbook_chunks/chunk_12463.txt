Plantar fasciitis is caused by long periods on the
feet, being overweight, and wearing shoes that do not
support the foot well. Teachers, mail carriers, runners,
and others who make heavy use of their feet are especial-
ly likely to suffer from plantar fasciitis.
Plantar fasciitis results in moderate to disabling heel
pain. If nine to twelve months of conservative treatment
(reducing time on feet, non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs, arch supports) under the supervision of a doctor
does not result in pain relief, a fasciotomy may be done.
Fasciotomy removes a small portion of the fascia to
relieve tension and pain. Connective tissue grows back
into the cut space left by the cut, effectively lengthening
the fascia.
When a fasciotomy is performed on other parts of
the body, it is usually done to relieve pressure from a
compression injury to a limb. This type of injury often
occurs during contact sports. The blood vessels of the
limb are damaged. They swell and leak, causing
inflammation. Fluid builds up in the area contained by
the fascia. A fasciotomy is done to relieve this pres-
sure and prevent tissue death. Similar injury occurs in
high voltage electrical burns where deep tissue dam-
age occurs.

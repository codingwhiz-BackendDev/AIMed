Calcium channel blockers are available only with a
physicianâ€™s prescription and are sold in tablet, capsule,
and injectable forms. Some commonly used calcium
channel blockers include amlopidine (Norvasc), dilti-
azem (Cardizem), isradipine (DynaCirc), nifedipine
(Adalat, Procardia), nicardipine (Cardene), and vera-
pamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan).
The recommended dosage depends on the type,
strength, and form of calcium channel blocker and the
condition for which it is prescribed. Correct dosage is
determined by the prescribing physician and further
information can be obtained from the pharmacist.
Calcium channel blockers should be taken as direct-
ed. Larger or more frequent doses should not be taken,
nor should doses be missed. This medicine may take sev-
eral weeks to noticeably lower blood pressure. The
patient taking calcium channel blockers should keep tak-
ing the medicine, to give it time to work. Once it begins
to work and symptoms improve, it should continue to be
taken as prescribed.
This medicine should not be discontinued without
checking with the prescribing physician. Some condi-
tions may worsen when patients stop taking calcium
channel blockers abruptly. The prescribing physician will
advise as to how to gradually taper down before stopping
the medication completely.

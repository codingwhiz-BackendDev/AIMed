Enterostomies are not considered high-risk opera-
tions by themselves. About 40% of ileostomy patients
have complications afterward, however; about 15%
require minor surgical corrections. Possible complica-
tions include:
• skin irritation caused by leakage of digestive fluids onto
the skin around the stoma, irritation is the most com-
mon complication of ileostomies
• diarrhea
• the development of abscesses
• gallstones or stones in the urinary tract
• inflammation of the ileum
• odors (can often be prevented by a change in diet)
• intestinal obstruction
• a section of the bowel pushing out of the body (pro-
lapse)

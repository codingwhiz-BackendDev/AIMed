Diagnosis begins with a high level of suspicion that
a quickly progressing illness with fever, sore throat, and
airway obstruction is very likely to be epiglottitis. If
epiglottitis is suspected, no efforts should be made to
look at the throat, or to swab the throat in order to obtain
a culture for identification of the causative organism.
These maneuvers may cause the larynx to go into spasm
(laryngospasm), completely closing the airway. These
procedures should only be performed in a fully-equipped
operating room, so that if laryngospasm occurs, a breath-
ing tube can be immediately placed in order to keep the
airway open.
An instrument called a laryngoscope is often used in
the operating room to view the epiglottis, which will
appear cherry-red and quite swollen. An x-ray picture
taken from the side of the neck should also be obtained.
The swollen epiglottis has a characteristic appearance,
called the “thumb sign.”

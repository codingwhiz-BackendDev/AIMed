Fracture repair is the process of rejoining and
realigning the ends of broken bones. This procedure is
usually performed by an orthopedist, general surgeon, or
family doctor. In cases of an emergency, first aid mea-
sures should be evoked for temporary realignment and
immobilization until proper medical help is available.

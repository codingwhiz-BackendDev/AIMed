Charcotâ€™s joints, also called neuropathic joint dis-
ease, is the result of two conditions present in the joint.
The first factor is the inability to feel pain in the joint due
to nerve damage. The second factor is that injuries to the
joint go unnoticed leading to instability and making the
joint more susceptible to further injury. Repeated small
injuries, strains and even fractures can go unnoticed until
finally the joint is permanently destroyed. Loss of the pro-
tective sensation of pain is what leads to the disintegration
of the joint and often leads to deformity in the joint.
Although this condition can affect any joint, the
knee is the joint most commonly involved. In individuals
with diabetes mellitus, the foot is most commonly
affected. The disease can involve only one joint or it may
affect two or three joints. More than three affected joints
is very rare. In all cases, the specific joint(s) affected
depends on the location of the nerve damage.

Parents of a child newly diagnosed with CP are not
likely to have the necessary expertise to coordinate the
full range of care their child will need. Although
knowledgeable and caring medical professionals are
indispensable for developing a care plan, a potentially
more important source of information and advice is
other parents who have dealt with the same set of diffi-
culties. Support groups for parents of children with CP
can be significant sources of both practical advice and
emotional support. Many cities have support groups
that can be located through the United Cerebral Palsy
Association, and most large medical centers have spe-
cial multidisciplinary clinics for children with develop-
mental disorders.

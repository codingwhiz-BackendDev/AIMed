Knowing the kinds of fish linked to ciguatera can
help a person avoid eating high-risk fish. However, over
400 different kinds of fish have been linked to the dis-
ease, even salmon. A particular fish in a given area may
be more likely to cause ciguatera than other fish. For
example, red snapper is most often the source of ciguat-
era in the Pacific, while barracuda is more likely to con-
tain the toxin in Florida. This is why it is illegal to sell
barracuda in Florida for human consumption. Cooking
the fish does not prevent ciguatera.

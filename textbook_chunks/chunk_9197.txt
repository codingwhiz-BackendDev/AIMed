X rays taken with contrast material in the stomach
readily demonstrate the site of the blockage and often the
ulcer that caused it. Gastroscopy is another way to evalu-

detect pyloric stenosis. It is often possible to feel the
enlarged pylorus, like an olive, deep under the ribs and see
the stomach rippling as it labors to force food through.

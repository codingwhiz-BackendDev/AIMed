There are several other forms of EDS that have not
been as clearly defined as the aforementioned types.
Forms of EDS within this category may present with
soft, mildly stretchable skin, shortened bones, chronic
diarrhea, joint hypermobility and dislocation, bladder
rupture, or poor wound healing. Inheritance patterns
within this group include X-linked recessive, autosomal
dominant, and autosomal recessive.

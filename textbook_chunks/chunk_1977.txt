dence of CP has not changed much in the last 20â€“30
years. Ironically, advances in medicine have decreased
the incidence from some causes, Rh disease for example,
but increased it from others, notably, prematurity and
multiple pregnancies. No particular ethnic groups seem
to be at higher risk for CP. However, people of disadvan-
taged background are at higher risk due to poorer access
to proper prenatal care and advanced medical services.

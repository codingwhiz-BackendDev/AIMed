Itching of the skin is one of the most troublesome
symptoms of CTCL. One alternative treatment for itchi-
ness is the application of a brewed solution of chickweed
that is applied to the skin using cloth compresses. Anoth-
er suggested topical application is a mixture of vitamin
E, vitamin A, unflavored yogurt, honey, and zinc oxide.
Evening primrose oil applied topically is also claimed to
reduce itch and promote healing.

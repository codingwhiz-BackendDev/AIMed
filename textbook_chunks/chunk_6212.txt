There are two basic ways to open the skull:
• a curving incision from behind the hairline, in front of
the ear, arching above the eye
• at the nape of the neck around the occipital lobe
The surgeon marks with a felt tip pen a large square
flap on the scalp that covers the surgical area. Following
this mark, the surgeon makes an incision into the skin as
far as the thin membrane covering the skull bone.
Because the scalp is well supplied with blood, the sur-
geon will have to seal many small arteries. The surgeon
then folds back a skin flap to expose the bone.
Using a high speed hand drill or an automatic cran-
iotome, the surgeon makes a circle of holes in the skull,
and pushes a soft metal guide under the bone from one
hole to the next. A fine wire saw is then moved along the
guide channel under the bone between adjacent holes.
The surgeon saws through the bone until the bone flap
can be removed to expose the brain.
After the surgery for the underlying cause is com-
pleted, the piece of skull is replaced and secured with
pieces of fine, soft wire. Finally, the surgeon sutures the
membrane, muscle, and skin of the scalp.

Cervical disk disease is typically diagnosed by an
orthopedist or a neurologist. After taking a medical his-
tory and conducting a physical examination, the doctor
will recommend an imaging procedure to gather more
information about the nature of the problem. This may
include a CT scan, an MRI, or myelography. In addi-
tion, an electromyogram (EMG) may be used to evalu-
ate the functioning of nerves in the arms, hands, or legs.
Cervical disk disease is typically covered by medical
insurance.

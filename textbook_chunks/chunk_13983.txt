Skin exposed to temperatures a little below the
freezing mark can take hours to freeze, but very cold skin
can freeze in minutes or seconds. Air temperature, wind
speed, and moisture all affect how cold the skin becomes.
A strong wind can lower skin temperature considerably
by dispersing the thin protective layer of warm air that
surrounds our bodies. Wet clothing readily draws heat
away from the skin because water is a potent conductor
of heat. The evaporation of moisture on the skin also pro-
duces cooling. For these reasons, wet skin or clothing on
a windy day can lead to frostbite even if the air tempera-
ture is above the freezing mark.
The extent of permanent injury, however, is deter-
mined not by how cold the skin and the underlying tis-
sues become but by how long they remain frozen. Conse-
quently, homeless people and others whose self-preser-
vation instincts may be clouded by alcohol or psychiatric
illness face a greater risk of frostbite-related amputation
because they are more likely to stay out in the cold when
prudence dictates seeking shelter or medical attention.
Alcohol also affects blood circulation in the extremities
in a way that can increase the severity of injury (as does
smoking). A review of 125 Saskatchewan frostbite cases
found a tie to alcohol in 46% and to psychiatric illness in
17%. Other risk factors identified by researchers include
inadequate clothing, previous cold injury, fatigue,
wound infection, atherosclerosis (an arterial disease),
and diabetes. Driving in poor weather can also be dan-

The International Federation of Gynecologists and
Obstetricians (FIGO) system usually is used to stage cer-
vical cancer:
• Stage 0: Carcinoma in situ; non-invasive cancer that is
confined to the layer of cells lining the cervix
• Stage I: Cancer that has spread into the connective tis-
sue of the cervix but is confined to the uterus
• Stage IA: Very small cancerous area that is visible only
with a microscope
• Stage IA1: Invasion area is less than 3 mm (0.13 in)
deep and 7 mm (0.33 in) wide
• Stage IA2: Invasion area is 3–5 mm (0.13–0.2 in) deep
and less than 7 mm (0.33 in) wide
• Stage IB: Cancer can be seen without a microscope or is
deeper than 5 mm (0.2 in) or wider than 7 mm (0.33 in)
• Stage IB1: Cancer is no larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)
• Stage IB2: Stage IB cancer is larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)
• Stage II: Cancer has spread from the cervix but is con-
fined to the pelvic region
• Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to the upper region of the
vagina, but not to the lower one-third of the vagina
• Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to the parametrial tissue
adjacent to the cervix
• Stage III: Cancer has spread to the lower one-third of
the vagina or to the wall of the pelvis and may be
blocking the ureters
• Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the lower vagina but
not to the pelvic wall
• Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the pelvic wall and/or
is blocking the flow of urine through the ureters to the
bladder
• Stage IV: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body
• Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder or rectum
• Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to distant organs such as
the lungs
• Recurrent: Following treatment, cancer has returned to
the cervix or some other part of the body
In addition to the stage of the cancer, factors such as
a woman’s age, general health, and preferences may
influence the choice of treatment. The exact location of
the cancer within the cervix and the type of cervical can-
cer also are important considerations.

A cerebral aneurysm occurs at a weak point in the
wall of a blood vessel (artery) that supplies blood to the
brain. Because of the flaw, the artery wall bulges outward
and fills with blood. This bulge is called an aneurysm. An
aneurysm can rupture, spilling blood into the surround-
ing body tissue. A ruptured cerebral aneurysm can cause
permanent brain damage, disability, or death.

Treated early enough, corneal infections will usually
resolve, perhaps even without the formation of an ulcer.
However, left untreated, infections can lead to ulcers and
the corneal ulcer can result in scarring or perforation of
the cornea. Other problems may occur as well, including
glaucoma. Patients with certain systemic diseases that
impede healing (such as diabetes mellitus or rheuma-
toid arthritis) may need more aggressive treatment. The
later the treatment, the more damage will be done and the
more scarring will result. Corneal transplant is standard
treatment with a high probability of success.

CMT affects the peripheral nerves, those groups of
nerve cells carrying information to and from the spinal
cord. CMT decreases the ability of these nerves to carry
motor commands to muscles, especially those furthest
from the spinal cord located in the feet and hands. As a
result, the muscles connected to these nerves eventually
weaken. CMT also affects the sensory nerves that carry
information from the limbs to the brain. Therefore peo-
ple with CMT also have sensory loss. This causes symp-
toms such as not being able to tell if something is hot or
cold or difficulties with balance.
There are two parts of the nerve that can be affected
in CMT. A nerve can be likened to an electrical wire, in
which the wire part is the axon of the nerve and the insu-
lation surrounding it is the myelin sheath. The job of the
myelin is to help messages travel very fast through the
nerves. CMT is usually classified depending on which
part of the nerve is affected. People who have problems
with the myelin have CMT type 1 and people who have
abnormalities of the axon have CMT type 2.
Specialized testing of the nerves, called nerve con-
duction testing (NCV), can be performed to determine if
a person has CMT1 or CMT2. These tests measure the
speed at which messages travel through the nerves. In
CMT1, the messages move too slowly, but in CMT2 the
messages travel at the normal speed.

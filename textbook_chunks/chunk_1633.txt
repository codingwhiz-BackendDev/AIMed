During catheter ablation, a long flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into a vein in the patient’s groin and guided toward
the heart. A special x-ray machine called a fluoroscope helps the electrophysiologist visualize correct placement. (Photo-

heart. Radio frequency energy is very rapidly alternating
electrical current that is produced at the tip of the
catheter that is placed inside the heart. At the same time
as the catheter is inserted, a second electrode is placed on
the patient’s skin. When the catheter is energized, the
body conducts the energy from the catheter’s tip, through
the heart and to the electrode on the skin’s surface, com-
pleting the circuit.
Although very little electricity is given off by the
catheter, the instrument does generate a large amount of
heat. This heat is absorbed by the heart tissue, causing a
small localized burn and destroying the tissue in contact
with the catheter tip; in this way, small regions of heart
tissue are burned in a controlled manner. This controlled
destruction of small sections of heart muscle actually
kills the nerve cells causing the irregular heartbeat, stop-
ping the nerve signals that are passing through this sec-
tion of the heart. This usually causes the irregular heart-
beat to be reset into a normal heartbeat.

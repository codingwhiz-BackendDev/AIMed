The word dyslexia is derived from the Greek word,
dys (meaning poor or inadequate) and the word lexis
(meaning words or language).
The National Institutes of Health estimates that
about 15% of the United States population is affected
by learning disabilities, mostly with problems in lan-
guage and reading. The condition appears in all ages,
races, and income levels. Dyslexia is not a disease, but
describes rather a different kind of mind that learns in a
different way from other people. Many people with the
condition are gifted and very productive; dyslexia is not
at all linked to low intelligence. In fact, intelligence has
nothing to do with dyslexia.
Dyslexic children seem to have trouble learning
early reading skills, problems hearing individual sounds
in words, analyzing whole words in parts, and blending
sounds into words. Letters such as “d” and “b” may be
confused.

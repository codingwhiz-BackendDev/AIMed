The best prevention for chancroid is to use a con-
dom during sexual intercourse. Chancroid can also be
prevented by abstinence (avoidance of any sexual con-
tact) and by being in a monogamous relationship with a
disease-free partner. To prevent the spread of chancroid,
it is important that all sexual contacts of the patient are
identified and treated.

Caffeine is found naturally in coffee, tea, and chocolate.
Colas and some other soft drinks contain it. Caffeine also
comes in tablet and capsule forms and can be bought without
a prescription. Over-the-counter caffeine brands include No
Doz, Overtime, Pep-Back, Quick-Pep, Caffedrine, and
Vivarin. Some pain relievers, medicines for migraine
headaches, and antihistamines also contain caffeine.

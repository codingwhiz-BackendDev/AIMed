If the person has cryoglobulin, the amount is report-
ed. Larger amounts of cryoglobulin are associated with
cancers or abnormalities involving white blood cells,
moderate amounts are associated with autoimmune dis-
orders and rheumatoid diseases, and smaller amounts are
associated with infections.
The type of cryoglobulin is also reported. Type I
cryoglobulin, also called monoclonal cryoglobulinemia,
is found in cancers or abnormalities of white blood cells.
Type II, also called mixed cryoglobulinemia, is associat-
ed with autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid diseases, and
infections, particularly chronic hepatitis B.
The physician must interpret the cryoglobulin result
along with other test results and the patientâ€™s clinical
condition and medical history.

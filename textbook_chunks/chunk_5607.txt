Depending on the medical need, various cooling
methods are used.
• Cold packs and ice bags are placed on a localized site
and provide topical relief. These compresses should be
covered with a waterproof material to protect the skin.
Repeated treatments produce the desired pain and
swelling relief.
• Cold treatments are placed on the groin and under the
arms to treat hyperthermia. Treatments are refreshed
periodically until the appropriate temperature is attained.
• A tepid sponge bath relieves fever without cooling the
body too fast. Eighty degrees Farenheit is still 20°F
below body temperature and yet warm enough not to
drive blood from the skin, thereby preventing the cool-
ing from getting to the body’s core. Limbs are bathed
first and then the chest, abdomen, back, and buttocks.
• Perfusion of isolated regions like the brain by using
cooled blood is an experimental treatment, offering
promising results for the treatment of stroke.

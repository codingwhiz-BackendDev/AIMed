ERCP-related complications can be broken down
into those related to medications used during the proce-
dure, the diagnostic part of the procedure, and those
related to endoscopic therapy. The overall complication
rate is 5–10%; most of those occur when diagnostic
ERCP is combined with a therapeutic procedure. During
the exam, the endoscopist can cut or stretch structures
(such as the muscle leading to the bile duct) to treat the
cause of the patient’s symptoms. Although the use of
sedatives carries a risk of decreasing cardiac and respira-
tory function, it is very difficult to perform these proce-
dures without these drugs.
The major complications related to diagnostic ERCP
are pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and
cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Bacteremia
(the passage of bacteria into the blood stream) and perfo-
ration (hole in the intestinal tract) are additional risks.

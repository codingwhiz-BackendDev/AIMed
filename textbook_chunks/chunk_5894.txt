twice, immediately after injecting the radiopharmaceuti-
cal and again four hours (and maybe 24 hours) later. It is
usually performed in a hospital’s nuclear medicine
department. Each scan takes 30–60 minutes.
Coronary angiography is the most accurate method
for making a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but it
is also the most invasive. It is a form of cardiac
catheterization that shows the heart’s chambers, great
vessels, and coronary arteries using x-ray technology.
During coronary angiography the patient is awake but
sedated. ECG electrodes are placed on the patient’s chest
and an intravenous line is inserted. A local anesthetic is
injected into the site where the catheter will be inserted.
The cardiologist inserts a catheter into a blood vessel and
guides it into the heart. A contrast dye is injected to make
the heart visible on x-ray cinematography. Coronary
angiography is performed in a cardiac catheterization
laboratory either in an outpatient or inpatient surgery
unit. It takes from 30 minutes to two hours.

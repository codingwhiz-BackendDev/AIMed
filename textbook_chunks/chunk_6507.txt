• Pigmentary changes. Both hypopigmentation (lighten-
ing of the skin) and hyperpigmentation (darkening of
the skin) are possible after cryotherapy. Both generally
last a few months, but can be longer lasting.
• Nerve damage. Though rare, damage to nerves is possi-
ble, particularly in areas where they lie closer to the
surface of the skin, such as the fingers, the wrist, and
the area behind the ear. Reports suggest this will disap-
pear within several months.

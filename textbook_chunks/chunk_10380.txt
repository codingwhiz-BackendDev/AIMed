Because encephalitis is due to infection, it may be
prevented by avoiding the infection. Minimizing contact
with others who have any of the viral illness listed above
may reduce the chances of becoming infected. Most
infections are spread by hand-to-hand or hand-to-mouth
contact; frequent hand washing may reduce the likeli-
hood of infection if contact cannot be avoided.
Mosquito-borne viruses may be avoided by prevent-
ing mosquito bites. Mosquitoes are most active at dawn
and dusk, and are most common in moist areas with
standing water. Minimizing exposed skin and use of
mosquito repellents on other areas can reduce the
chances of being bitten.

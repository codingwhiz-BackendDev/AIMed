When testing for cortisol levels through the blood, a
blood specimen is usually collected at 8 A.M. and again at
4 P.M. It should be noted that normal values may be trans-
posed in individuals who have worked during the night
and slept during the day for long periods of time.
When testing for cortisol level through the urine, a
24-hour urine sample is collected, refrigerated, and sent
to the reference laboratory for examination.

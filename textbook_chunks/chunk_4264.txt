Most people who are infected with coccidiodomycosis
only suffer from the mild, acute form of the disease and
recover without further complications. Patients who suffer
from chronic coccidiodomycosis and who have no underly-
ing lung or immune system diseases also stand a good
change of recovery, although they must be alert to a relapse.
The picture for patients with the disseminated form of
the disease, many of whom have AIDS, is less positive.
Untreated disseminated coccidiodomycosis is almost
always fatal within a short time. With treatment, chance of
survival increases, but the death rate remains high when
meningitis or diffuse lung (pulmonary) disease is present.
AIDS patients must constantly guard against relapse.

will dip a cotton swab or other applicator into a cup con-
taining a “cryogen,” such as liquid nitrogen, and apply it
directly to the skin growth to freeze it. At a temperature of
-320°F (-196°C), liquid nitrogen is the coldest cryogen
available. The goal is to freeze the skin growth as quickly
as possible, and then let it thaw slowly to cause maximum
destruction of the skin cells. A second application may be
necessary depending on the size of the growth. In another
cryotherapy technique, a device is used to direct a small
spray of liquid nitrogen or other cryogen directly onto the
skin growth. Freezing may last from five to 20 seconds,
depending on the size of the lesion. A second freeze-thaw
cycle may be required. Sometimes, the physician will
insert a small needle connected to a thermometer into the
lesion to make certain the lesion is cooled to a low
enough temperature to guarantee maximum destruction.
In a third option, liquid nitrogen or another cryogen is cir-
culated through a probe to cool it to low temperatures.
The probe is then brought into direct contact with the skin
lesion to freeze it. The freeze time can take two to three
times longer than with the spray technique.

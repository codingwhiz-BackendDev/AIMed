In the majority of cases, diagnosis is based on the
characteristic symptoms that the virus produces (such as
the chest pain in pleurodynia). Rarely is it necessary to
identify a specific strain of virus causing the illness. It is
more important to be certain that the infection is due to a
virus which does not require treatment with antibiotics.
Culture, or growing the organism outside of the body,
is helpful only when obtained from areas that tend to indi-
cate recent infection, such as from swollen joints, cere-
brospinal fluid, or blood. Cultures from other areas, such
as the throat, can be misleading. This is because the virus
may remain for long periods of time in places with a large
amount of lymphatic tissue. As a rule, cultures done early
in the illness are more likely to identify the virus.
New techniques that involve identification of viral
genetic material (PCR) are useful in certain cases, but are
not indicated for routine testing.

A congested or stuffy nose is a common symptom of
colds and allergies. This congestion results when mem-
branes lining the nose become swollen. Decongestants
relieve the swelling by narrowing the blood vessels that
supply the nose. This reduces the blood supply to the
swollen membranes, causing the membranes to shrink.

There is no cure for CMT. However, physical and
occupational therapy are an important part of CMT treat-
ment. Physical therapy is used to preserve range of motion
and minimize deformity caused by muscle shortening, or
contracture. Braces are sometimes used to improve control
of the lower extremities that can help tremendously with
balance. After wearing braces, people often find that they
have more energy because they are using less energy to
focus on their walking. Occupational therapy is used to
provide devices and techniques that can assist tasks such
as dressing, feeding, writing, and other routine activities of
daily life. Voice-activated software can also help people
who have problems with fine motor control.
It is very important that people with CMT avoid
injury that causes them to be immobile for long periods
of time. It is often difficult for people with CMT to return
to their original strength after injury.
There is a long list of medications that should be
avoided if possible by people diagnosed with CMT such as
hydralazine (Apresoline), megadoses of vitamin A, B6, and
D, Taxol, and large intravenous doses of penicillin. Com-
plete lists are available from the CMT support groups. Peo-
ple considering taking any of these medications should
weigh the risks and benefits with their physician.

ciencies, and imbalances of fluids and electrolytes in the
blood. Severe dehydration can also cause delirium.
Drug intoxication (“intoxication confusional state”)
is responsible for up to 20% of delirium cases, either
from side effects, overdose, or deliberate ingestion of a
mind-altering substance. Medicinal drugs with delirium
as a possible side effect or result of overdose include:
• anticholinergics, including atropine, scopolamine,
chlorpromazine (an antipsychotic), and diphenhy-
dramine (an antihistamine)
• sedatives, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
and ethanol (drinking alcohol)
• antidepressant drugs
• anticonvulsant drugs
• nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
including ibuprofen and acetaminophen
• corticosteroids, including prednisone
• anticancer drugs, including methotrexate and procar-
bazine
• lithium
• cimetidine
• antibiotics
• L-dopa
Delirium may result from ingestion of legal or ille-
gal psychoactive drugs, including:
• ethanol (drinking alcohol)
• marijuana
• LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) and other hallucino-
gens
• amphetamines
• cocaine
• opiates, including heroin and morphine
• PCP (phencyclidine)
• inhalants
Drug withdrawal may also cause delirium. Delirium
tremens, or “DTs,” may occur during alcohol withdrawal
after prolonged or intense consumption. Withdrawal
symptoms are also possible from many of the psychoac-
tive prescription drugs.
Poisons may cause delirium (“toxic encephalopa-
thy”), including:
• solvents, such as gasoline, kerosene, turpentine, ben-
zene, and alcohols
• carbon monoxide
• refrigerants (Freon)

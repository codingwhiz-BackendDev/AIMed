Infection with the common human papilloma virus
(HPV) is a cause of approximately 90% of all cervical
cancers. There are more than 80 types of HPV. About 30
of these types can be transmitted sexually, including
those that cause genital warts (papillomas). About half
of the sexually transmitted HPVs are associated with cer-
vical cancer. These “high-risk” HPVs produce a protein
that can cause cervical epithelial cells to grow uncontrol-
lably. The virus makes a second protein that interferes
with tumor suppressors that are produced by the human
immune system. The HPV-16 strain is thought to be a
cause of about 50% of cervical cancers.
More than six million women in the United States
have persistent HPV infections, for which there is no
cure. Nevertheless, most women with HPV do not devel-
op cervical cancer.

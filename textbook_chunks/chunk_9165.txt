The treatment of dry mouth involves the manage-
ment of the condition causing it. If dry mouth is caused
by medication, the medication should be changed. If dry
mouth is caused by blockage of the salivary ducts, the
cause of the blockage should be investigated. When sys-
temic diseases, such as diabetes and anemia, are brought
under control dry mouth problems may decrease.
The use of caffeine-containing beverages, alcoholic
beverages, and mouthwashes containing alcohol should
be minimized. The drinking of water and fruit juices will
decrease dry mouth problems. Chewing gum and lemon
drops can be used to stimulate saliva flow. Bitters also
can initiate salivary flow as long as the salivary glands
and ducts are functional. Commercial saliva substitutes
are available without prescription and can be used as fre-
quently as needed. Use of a humidifier in the bedroom
reduces nighttime oral dryness.

The most important precaution related to both ERCP
and ERS is to have the procedure performed by an expe-

many other gastrointestinal endoscopic studies, including
ERCP. Patients should inquire as to the physicianâ€™s expe-
rience with the procedure. The physician should also be
informed of any allergies, medication use, and medical
problems.

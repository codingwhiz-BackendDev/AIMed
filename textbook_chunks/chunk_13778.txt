Dust, dirt, sand, or other airborne material can lodge
in the eyes, causing minor irritation and redness. More
serious damage can be caused by hard or sharp objects
that penetrate the surface and become embedded in the
cornea or conjunctiva (the mucous membranes around
the inner surface of the eyelids). Swelling, redness,
bleeding from the surface blood vessels, sensitivity to
light, and sudden vision problems are all symptoms of
foreign matter in the eyes.

Cesarean sections, also called c-sections, are per-
formed whenever abnormal conditions complicate labor
and vaginal delivery, threatening the life or health of the
mother or the baby. The procedure is performed in the
United States on nearly one of every four babies deliv-
ered—more than 900,000 babies each year. The proce-
dure is often used in cases where the mother has had a
previous c-section. Dystocia, or difficult labor, is the
other common cause of c-sections.
Difficult labor is commonly caused by one of the
three following conditions: abnormalities in the mother’s
birth canal; abnormalities in the position of the fetus; or
abnormalities in the labor, including weak or infrequent
contractions.
Another major factor is fetal distress, a condition
where the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal brain
damage can result from oxygen deprivation. Fetal dis-
tress is often related to abnormalities in the position of
the fetus or abnormalities in the birth canal, causing
reduced blood flow through the placenta. Other condi-
tions also can make c-section advisable, such as vaginal
herpes, hypertension, and diabetes in the mother.

Drugs can be used to treat the hypertension and
heart failure. Surgery is recommended for infants with
other, associated cardiac defects and for those infants not
responding to drug therapy. Surgery is indicated for
infants that donâ€™t require immediate surgery, but who
develop severe hypertension during the first several
months of life. Patients are advised to avoid vigorous
exercise prior to surgical correction of the coarctation.
Recoarctation can occur in some patients, even if they
have had surgery.

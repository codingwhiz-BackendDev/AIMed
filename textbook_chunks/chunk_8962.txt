Chromosome—The structures that carry genetic
information. Chromosomes are located within
every cell, and are responsible for directing the
development and functioning of all the cells in the
body. The normal number is 46 (23 pairs).
Karyotype—The specific chromosomal makeup of
a particular cell.
Mental retardation—A condition where an indi-
vidual has a lower-than-normal IQ, and thus is
developmentally delayed.
Mosaic—A term referring to a genetic situation, in
which an individual’s cells do not have the exact
same composition of chromosomes. In Down syn-
drome, this may mean that some of the individ-
ual’s cells have a normal 46 chromosomes, while
other cells have an abnormal 47 chromosomes.
Nondisjunction—A genetic term referring to an
event which takes place during cell division, in
which a genetic accident causes an egg or sperm
cell to have 24 chromosomes, rather than the nor-
mal 23.
Translocation—A genetic term referring to a situa-
tion during cell division in which a piece of one
chromosome breaks off and sticks to another chro-
mosome.
Trisomy—The condition of having three identical
chromosomes, instead of the normal two.

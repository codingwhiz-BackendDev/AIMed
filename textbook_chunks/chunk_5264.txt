About 50,000 Americans develop cardiomyopathy
each year. Of those, 87% have congestive cardiomyopa-
thy. Primary cardiomyopathy accounts for only 1% of all
deaths from heart disease.
When the heart muscle is damaged by a disease
process, it cannot pump enough blood to meet the bodyâ€™s
needs. Uninjured areas of the walls of the two lower heart
chambers (called ventricles) stretch to make up for the
lost pumping action. At first, the enlarged chambers allow
more blood to be pumped with less force. The stretched
muscle can also contract more forcefully. Over time, the
heart muscle continues to stretch, ultimately becoming
weaker. The heart is forced to work harder to pump blood
by beating faster. Eventually it cannot keep up, and blood
backs up into the veins, legs, and lungs. When this hap-
pens, the condition is called congestive heart failure.
Congestive cardiomyopathy usually affects both
ventricles. Blood backed up into the lungs from the left
ventricle causes fluid to congest the lung tissue. This is
called pulmonary edema. When the right ventricle fails
to pump enough blood, blood backs up into the veins
causing edema in the legs, feet, ankles, and abdomen.

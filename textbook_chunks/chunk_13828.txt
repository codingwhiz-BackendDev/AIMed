After surgery, x rays may be again taken through the
cast or splint to evaluate if rejoined pieces remain in good
position for healing. This is usually performed either before
the application of the splint or at least before the patient is
awakened from the general anesthesia. The patient needs to
be cautious not to place excess pressure on any part of the
cast until it is completely dry. The patient also should avoid
excess pressure on the operative site until complete healing
has taken place and the injury has been re-examined by the
physician. If the cast becomes exposed to moisture it may
soften and require repair. The patient should also be
instructed to keep the injured region propped up whenever
possible to reduce the possibility of swelling.

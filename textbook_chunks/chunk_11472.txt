Esophageal atresia is a serious birth defect in which
the esophagus, the long tube that connects the mouth to
the stomach, is segmented and closed off at any point.
This condition usually occurs with tracheoesophageal
fistula, a condition in which the esophagus is improperly
attached to the trachea, the nearby tube that connects the
nasal area to the lungs. Esophageal atresia occurs in
approximately 1 in 4,000 live births.

Similar to surgical intervention, radiotherapy is a
localized treatment. It involves the administration of ion-
izing radiation to a solid tumor location. This generates
reactive oxygen molecules, causing the destruction of
DNA in local cells. There are three commonly used
radiotherapy beams: gamma rays from a linear accelera-
tor machine produce a focused beam; orthovoltage rays
are of less energy, thus penetrate less and typically deliv-
er higher doses to superficial tissues (efficient for treat-
ing skin cancers); and megavoltage rays are high energy
producing beams and can penetrate deeply situated inter-

common routes can deliver radiation. Brachytherapy
delivers radiation to a local area by placing radioactive
materials within close proximity to the cancerous site.
Teletherapy delivers radiation to a specific area using an
external beam machine.

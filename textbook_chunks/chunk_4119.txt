The name of this disorder arises from the fact that
malfunction of clotting factors cause platelets to clot in
small blood vessels throughout the body. This action leads
to a lack of clotting factors and platelets at a site of injury
that requires clotting. Patients with disseminated intravas-
cular coagulation (DIC) will bleed abnormally even
though there is no history of coagulation abnormality.

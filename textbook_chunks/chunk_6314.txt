Before 1995, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was little-
known outside of the medical profession; even within it,
many practitioners did not know much about it. Most
doctors had never seen a case. With the recognition of a
so-called “new variant” or simply variant form of CJD
with the strong possibility that those with it became
infected simply by eating contaminated beef, CJD has
become one of the most talked-about diseases in the
world. Additionally, the radical theory that the infectious
agent is a normal protein that has been changed in its
form has also sparked much interest.
First described in the first part of the twentieth cen-
tury independently by Cretzfeldt and Jakob, CJD is a
neurodegenerative disease causing a rapidly progressing
dementia ending in death, usually within eight months
of the onset of symptoms. It is also a very rare disease,
affecting only about one in every million in the popula-
tion through out the world. In the United States, CJD is
thought to affect about 250 people each year. CJD affects
adults primarily between ages 50 and 75.

Response to treatment for DUB is highly individual
and is not easy to predict. The outcome depends largely
on the womanâ€™s medical condition and her age. Many
women, especially adolescents, are successfully treated
with hormones (usually oral contraceptives). As a last
resort, hysterectomy removes the source of the problem
by removing the uterus, but this operation is not without
risk, or the possibility of complications.

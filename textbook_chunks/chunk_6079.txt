The goals of treatment are to reduce inflammation and
to control pain. To accomplish these goals, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are used, with ibupro-
fen usually selected as the drug of choice. Other NSAIDS
options are flurbiprofen, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, and
naproxen. Additional treatment recommendations include
the use of local heat, biofeedback, and gentle stretching of
the pectoralis muscles two to three times a day.
For more difficult cases, where the patient continues
to exhibit pain and discomfort, cortisone injections are
used as therapy.

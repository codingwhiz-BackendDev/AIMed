The colposcope helps to identify abnormal areas of
the cervix or vagina so that small pieces of tissue (biop-
sies) can be taken for further analysis.
Colposcopy is used to identify or rule out the exis-
tence of any precancerous conditions in the cervical tis-
sue. If a PAP test shows abnormal cell growth, further
testing, such as colposcopy, often is required. A PAP test
is a screening test that involves scraping cells from the
outside of the cervix. If abnormal cells are found, the
physician will attempt to find the area that produced the
abnormal cells and remove it for further study (biopsy).
Only then can a diagnosis be made.
Colposcopy may also be performed if the cervix
looks abnormal during a routine examination. It may also
be suggested for women with genital warts and for
diethylstilbestrol (DES) daughters (women whose moth-
ers took DES when pregnant with them).

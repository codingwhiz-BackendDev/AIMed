Physicians who regularly work with AIDS patients
have the most experience in diagnosing cryptococcosis.
The preferred methods of diagnosis use simple and very
accurate blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests that
detect the presence of an antigen produced by the fungus.
The cerebrospinal fluid test is generally more sensitive to
detecting the meningitis form of the infection. CSF is
collected during a procedure called a lumbar puncture,
during which an anesthetic is applied to a small area of
the back near the spine and a needle is used to withdraw
a sample of cerebrospinal fluid from the space between
the vertebrae and the spinal cord. Once obtained, a small
amount of ink (called India ink) is added to a sample of
CSF or a sample prepared from skin lesions. If the fun-
gus is present, it will become visible when the ink binds
to the capsule or covering that surrounds the fungus.
Faster results are obtained with the India ink test, but it is
less accurate than the blood test (75â€“85% accuracy com-
pared to 99% accuracy with the blood test) because some
strains are not visible using this method. Antigen tests
are routinely recommended for non-symptomatic
patients with advanced AIDS.
Another way to diagnose cryptococcosis is to cul-
ture a sample of sputum, tissue from a lung biopsy, or
CSF in the laboratory to isolate the fungus. Cultures are
also done to assess the effectiveness of treatment.
Chest x rays are useful in assessing lung damage and
may reveal a single mass or multiple distinct nodules, but
the x ray alone does not lead to a definitive diagnosis of
cryptococcosis.

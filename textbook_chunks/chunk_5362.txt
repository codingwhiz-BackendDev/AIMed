Conjunctivitis may be caused by a viral infection,
such as a cold, acute respiratory infection, or disease
such as measles, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster. Symp-
toms include mild to severe discomfort in one or both
eyes, redness, swelling of the eyelids, and watery, yellow,
or green discharge. Symptoms may last anywhere from
several days to two weeks. Infection with an adenovirus,
however, may also cause a significant amount of pus-like
discharge and a scratchy, foreign body-type of sensation
in the eye. This may also be accompanied by swelling
and tenderness of the lymph nodes near the ear.
Bacterial conjunctivitis can occur in adults and chil-
dren and is caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus,
Streptococcus, and Hemophilus. Symptoms of bacterial
conjunctivitis include a pus-like discharge and crusty
eyelids after awakening. Redness of the conjunctiva can
be mild to severe and may be accompanied by swelling.
Persons with symptoms of conjunctivitis who are sexual-
ly active may possibly be infected with the bacteria that
cause either gonorrhea or chlamydia. There may be
large amounts of pus-like discharge, and symptoms may
include intolerance to light (photophobia), watery
mucous discharge, and tenderness in the lymph nodes
near the ear that may persist for up to three months.
Conjunctivitis may also be caused by environmental
hazards, such as wind, smoke, dust, and allergic reac-
tions caused by pollen, dust, or grass. Symptoms range
from itching and redness to a mucous discharge. Persons
who wear contact lenses may develop allergic conjunc-
tivitis caused by the various eye solutions and foreign
proteins contained in them.
Other less common causes of conjunctivitis include
exposure to sun lamps or the electrical arcs used during
welding, and problems with inadequate drainage of the
tear ducts.

The external sphincter muscle is the ring-like muscle
that controls urine release from the bladder. When a
patient cannot voluntarily control urination (inconti-
nence), a physician may order this test to determine if the
problem is caused by the failure of this muscle. The vol-
untary contraction or release of a muscle such as the
external sphincter involves a complex process in which
the nerves controlling the muscle signal it to move
through the release and uptake of chemicals called neu-
rotransmitters and the generation of electrical impulses.
This test records the electrical impulses given off when
the muscle contracts or relaxes and allows the physician
to determine if the muscle is working properly, if it has
been damaged by disease, or some other condition.

Many diseases and injuries can interfere with the abil-
ity to feel pain. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus,
spinal injuries and diseases, alcoholism, and even syphilis
can all lead to a loss of the ability to feel pain in some
areas. Lack of pain sensation may also be congenital.
The symptoms of Charcotâ€™s joints can go unnoticed
for some time and may be confused with osteoarthritis
in the beginning. Swelling and stiffness in a joint without
the expected pain, or with less pain than would be
expected, are the primary symptoms of this condition. As
the condition progresses, however, the joint can become
very painful due to fluid build-up and bony growths.

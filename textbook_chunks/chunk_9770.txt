Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by infec-
tion with Ehrlichia bacteria. Ticks are small, blood-suck-
ing arachnids. Although some ticks carry disease-causing
organisms, most do not. When an animal or person is bit-
ten by a tick that carries bacteria, the bacteria are passed
to that person or animal during the tickâ€™s feeding process.
It is believed that the tick must remain attached to the
person or animal for at least 24 hours to spread the infec-
tion.
There are two forms of ehrlichiosis in the United
States; human monocytic ehrlichiosis and human gran-
ulocytic ehrlichiosis. Monocytic ehrlichiosis is caused
by Ehrlichia chaffeensis, which is spread by the Lone
Star tick, Amblyomma americanum. As of early 1998,
about 400 cases of monocytic ehrlichiosis had been
reported in 30 states, primarily in the southeastern and
south central United States. The bacteria that causes
granulocytic ehrlichiosis is not known, but suspected to
be either Ehrlichia equi or Ehrlichia phagocytophila.
Granulocytic ehrlichiosis is probably spread by the
blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis (which also spreads
Lyme disease). About 100 cases of granulocytic ehrli-
chiosis have been reported in Connecticut, Massachu-
setts, Rhode Island, Minnesota, New York, and Wiscon-
sin.

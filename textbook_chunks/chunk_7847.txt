Allergic reactions are genetically determined, and
different substances cause contact dermatitis to develop
in different people. A reaction to resin produced by poi-
son ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac is the most com-
mon source of symptoms. It is, in fact, the most common
allergy in this country, affecting one of every two people
in the United States.
Flowers, herbs, and vegetables can also affect the
skin of some people. Burns and sunburn increase the
risk of dermatitis developing, and chemical irritants that
can cause the condition include:
• chlorine
• cleansers
• detergents and soaps
• fabric softeners
• glues used on artificial nails
• perfumes
• topical medications
Contact dermatitis can develop when the first con-
tact occurs or after years of use or exposure.
Stasis dermatitis, a consequence of poor circulation,
occurs when leg veins can no longer return blood to the
heart as efficiently as they once did. When that happens,
fluid collects in the lower legs and causes them to swell.
Stasis dermatitis can also result in a rash that can break
down into sores known as stasis ulcers.
The cause of nummular dermatitis is not known, but
it usually occurs in cold weather and is most common in
people who have dry skin. Hot weather and stress can
aggravate this condition, as can the following:
• allergies
• fabric softeners
• soaps and detergents
• wool clothing
• bathing more than once a day
Atopic dermatitis can be caused by allergies, asth-
ma, or stress, and there seems to be a genetic predisposi-
tion for atopic conditions. It is sometimes caused by an
allergy to nickel in jewelry.
Seborrheic dermatitis (for which there may also be a
genetic predisposition) is usually caused by overproduc-
tion of the oil glands. In adults it can be associated with
diabetes mellitus or gold allergy. In infants and adults it
may be caused by a biotin deficiency.

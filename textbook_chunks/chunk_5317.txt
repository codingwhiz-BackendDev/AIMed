When a baby is born with a hole in the septum (the
wall separating the right and left sides of the heart),
blood leaks from the left side of the heart to the right,
or from a higher pressure zone to a lower pressure
zone. A major leakage can lead to enlargement of the
heart and failing circulation. The most common types
of septal defects are atrial septal defect, an opening
between the two upper heart chambers, and ventricu-
lar septal defect, an opening between the two lower
heart chambers. Ventricular septal defect accounts for
about 15% of all cases of congenital heart disease in
the United States.

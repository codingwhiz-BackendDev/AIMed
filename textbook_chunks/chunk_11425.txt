E. coli bacteria may give rise to infections in
wounds, the urinary tract, biliary tract, and abdominal
cavity (peritonitis). This organism may cause sep-
ticemia, neonatal meningitis, infantile gastroenteritis,
tourist diarrhea, and hemorrhagic diarrhea. An E. coli
infection may also arise due to environmental exposure.
Infections with this type of bacteria pose a serious threat
to public health with outbreaks arising from food and
water that has been contaminated with human or animal
feces or sewage. This type of bacteria has been used as a
biological indicator for safety of drinking water since the
1890s. Exposure may also occur during hospitalization,
resulting in pneumonia
in immunocompromised
patients or those on a ventilator

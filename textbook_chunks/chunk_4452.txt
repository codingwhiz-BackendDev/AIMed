Rocking a baby in a quiet, darkened room can pre-
vent overstimulation, and a baby usually calms down
when cuddled in a warm, soft blanket.
Colicky babies cry less when they are soothed by the
motion of a wind-up swing, a car ride, or being carried in
a parent’s arms. Pacifiers can soothe babies who are
upset, but a pacifier should never be attached to a string.
A doctor should be notified if a baby who has been
diagnosed with colic:
• develops a rectal fever higher than 101°F (38.3°C)
• cries for more than four hours
• vomits
• has diarrhea or stools that are black or bloody
• loses weight
• eats less than normal

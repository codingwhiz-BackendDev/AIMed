In male patients, the doctor will cleanse the opening
to the urethra with an antiseptic before collecting the
urine sample. The first 10 ml of specimen are collected
separately. The patient then voids a midstream sample of
200 ml. Following the second sample, the doctor will
massage the patientâ€™s prostate and collect several drops
of prostatic fluid. The patient then voids a third urine
specimen for prostatic culture.
A high bacterial count in the first urine specimen or
the prostatic specimens indicates urethritis or prostate
infections respectively. A bacterial count greater than
100,000 bacteria CFU/ml in the midstream sample sug-
gests a bladder or kidney infection.

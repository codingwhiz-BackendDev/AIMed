The cause of common variable immunodeficiency is
not known, although some forms seem to be hereditary.
The main symptom is recurring infections that tend to be
chronic rather than acute. Patients may also develop diar-
rhea and, as a consequence of the diarrhea, do not absorb
food efficiently. This can lead to malnourishment that can
aggravate the disorder. Common variable immunodefi-
ciency normally appears in children after the age of 10.
Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis,
thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus and cer-
tain cancers such as lymphomas and leukemias may be
associated with common variable immunodeficiency.

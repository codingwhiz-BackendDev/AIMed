a hammer, closing a door, or sport accidents usually cause
these injuries. These fractures can be simple, requiring
little treatment or more complicated involving the joint.
The accident may involve the point of insertion of a ten-
don. Usually this occurs when the terminal joint is being
forced to flex while held straight. This motion typically
occurs when tucking in sheets during bed making, a com-
mon cause of tendon injury. This injury causes a loss of
extension (straightening the finger) ability.

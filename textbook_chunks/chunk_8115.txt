People who have diabetes have a greater-than-average
chance of developing foot infections. Because a person
who has diabetes may not feel foot pain or discomfort,
problems can remain undetected until fever, weakness, or
other signs of systemic infection appear. As a result, even
minor irritations occur more often, heal more slowly, and
are more likely to result in serious health problems.
With diabetes, foot infections occur more frequently
because the disease causes nervous system changes and
poor circulation. Because the nerves that control sweat-
ing no longer work, the skin of the feet can become very
dry and cracked, and calluses tend to occur more fre-
quently and build up faster. If not trimmed regularly,
these calluses can turn into open sores or ulcers. Because
diabetic nerve damage can cause a loss of sensation (neu-
ropathy), if the feet are not regularly inspected, an ulcer
can quickly become infected and, if not treated, may
result in the death of tissue (gangrene) or amputation.
The risk of infection is greatest for people who are
over the age of 60 and for those who have one or more of
the following:
• poorly controlled diabetes
• foot ulcers
• laser treatment for changes in the retina
• kidney or vascular disease
• loss of sensation (neuropathy)

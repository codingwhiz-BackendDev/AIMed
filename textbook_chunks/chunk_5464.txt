Diagnosis begins with a physical examination and
asking the patient questions about his or her health and
daily activities. When contact dermatitis is suspected, the
doctor attempts to learn as much as possible about the
patient’s hobbies, workplace duties, use of medications
and cosmetics, etc.—anything that might shed light on
the source of the disease. In some cases, an examination
of the home or workplace is undertaken. If the dermatitis
is mild, responds well to treatment, and does not recur,
ordinarily the investigation is at an end. More difficult
cases require patch testing to identify the allergen.
Two methods of patch testing are currently used. The
most widely used method, the Finn chamber method,
employs a multiwell, aluminum patch. Each well is filled
with a small amount of the allergen being tested and the
patch is taped to normal skin on the patient’s upper back.
After 48 hours, the patch is removed and an initial reading
is taken. A second reading is made a few days later. The
second method of patch testing involves applying a small
amount of the test substance to directly to normal skin
and covering it with a dressing that keeps air out and
keeps the test substance in (occlusive dressing). After 48
hours, the dressing is taken off to see if a reaction has
occurred. Identifying the allergen may require repeated
testing, can take weeks or months, and is not always suc-
cessful. Moreover, patch testing works only with ACD,
though it is considered an essential step in ruling out ICD.

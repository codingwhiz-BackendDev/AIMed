Early stage diabetic neuropathy can usually be
reversed with good glucose control. Once nerve damage
has occurred it cannot be reversed. The prognosis is largely
dependent on the management of the underlying condition,
diabetes, which may halt the progression of the neuropathy
and improve symptoms. Recovery, if it occurs, is slow.

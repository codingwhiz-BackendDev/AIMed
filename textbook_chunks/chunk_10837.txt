The most important parts of the physical examina-
tion are checking for signs of severe fluid loss and exam-
ining the abdomen to rule out typhoid fever. The doctor
will look at the inside of the patient’s mouth and evaluate
the skin for signs of dehydration. The presence of a skin
rash and an enlarged spleen suggests typhoid rather than a
bacterial infection. If the patient’s abdomen hurts when the
doctor examines it, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely.

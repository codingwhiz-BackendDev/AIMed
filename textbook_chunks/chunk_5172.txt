Because the abnormalities of this hip problem often
vary, a thorough physical examination is necessary for
an accurate diagnosis of congenital hip dysplasia. The
hip disorder can be diagnosed by moving the hip to
determine if the head of the femur is moving in and out
of the hip joint. One specific method, called the Ortolani
test, begins with each of the examiners’ hands around the
infant’s knees, with the second and third fingers pointing
down the child’s thigh. With the legs abducted (moved
apart), the examiner may be able to discern a distinct
clicking sound with motion. If symptoms are present
with a noted increase in abduction, the test is considered
positive for hip joint instability. It is important to note
this test is only valid a few weeks after birth.
The Barlow method is another test performed with the
infant’s hip brought together with knees in full bent posi-
tion. The examiner’s middle finger is placed over the out-
side of the hipbone while the thumb is placed on the inner
side of the knee. The hip is abducted to where it can be felt
if the hip is sliding out and then back in the joint. In older
babies, if there is a lack of range of motion in one hip or
even both hips, it is possible that the movement is blocked
because the hip has dislocated and the muscles have con-
tracted in that position. Also in older infants, hip disloca-
tion is evident if one leg looks shorter than the other.
X-ray films can be helpful in detecting abnormal find-
ings of the hip joint. X rays may also be helpful in finding
the proper positioning of the hip joint for treatments of

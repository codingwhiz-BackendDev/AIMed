Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical treat-
ment for severe mental illness in which a small, carefully
controlled amount of electricity is introduced into the
brain. This electrical stimulation, used in conjunction with
anesthesia and muscle relaxant medications, produces a
mild generalized seizure or convulsion. While used to treat
a variety of psychiatric disorders, it is most effective in the
treatment of severe depression, and provides the most
rapid relief currently available for this illness.

Bowel obstruction requires a surgeon, sometimes
immediately. Newer surgical techniques constantly
improve the outcome, but obstruction is a mechanical
problem that needs a mechanical solution. Most adults
who come to surgery for obstruction have suffered for
years from peptic ulcer disease. They will usually benefit
from ulcer surgery at the same time their obstruction is
relieved. The surgeon will therefore select a procedure
that combines relief of obstruction with remedy for ulcer
disease. There are many choices. In fact, even without
obstruction, functional considerations require ulcer
surgery to include enhancement of stomach emptying.
To treat an infant with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,
some surgeons have had success with forceful balloon
dilation of the pylorus done through a gastroscope, but
the standard procedure is to cut across the overdeveloped
circular muscle that is constricting the stomach outlet.
There are reports of infant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
remitting without surgery following a very careful feed-
ing schedule, but mortality is unacceptably high.

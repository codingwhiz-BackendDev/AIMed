Coughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory
infections may be effectively treated with botanical and
homeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will vary
and be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Some
combination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathic
cough formulas can be very effective for cough relief.
Lingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treated
by a trained practitioner.
Many health practitioners advise increasing fluids
and breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen-
ing chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavored
with honey as a temporary home remedy for coughs
caused by colds or flu. Various vitamins, such as vitamin
C, may be helpful in preventing or treating conditions
(including colds and flu) that lead to coughs. Avoiding of
mucous-producing foods can be effective in healing a
cough condition. These mucous-producing foods can
vary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy products
are a major mucous-producing food for most people.

Erythema multiforme appears on the skin and the
mucous membranes (the lining of the mouth, digestive
tract, vagina, and other organs). Large, symmetrical red
blotches appear all over the skin in a circular pattern. On
mucous membranes, it begins as blisters and progresses
to ulcers. A more advanced form, called Stevens-Johnson
syndrome, can be severe and even fatal.

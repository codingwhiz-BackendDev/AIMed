In mechanical debridement, a saline-moistened
dressing is allowed to dry overnight and adhere to the
dead tissue. When the dressing is removed, the dead tis-
sue is pulled away too. This process is one of the oldest
methods of debridement. It can be very painful because
the dressing can adhere to living as well as nonliving tis-
sue. Because mechanical debridement cannot select
between good and bad tissue, it is an unacceptable
debridement method for clean wounds where a new layer
of healing cells is already developing.

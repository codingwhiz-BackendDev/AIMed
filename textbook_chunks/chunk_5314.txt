When heart valves, arteries, or veins are narrowed,
they partly or completely block the flow of blood. The
most common obstruction defects are pulmonary valve
stenosis, aortic valve stenosis, and coarctation of the
aorta. Bicuspid aortic valve and subaortic stenosis are
less common.
Stenosis is a narrowing of the valves or arteries. In
pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve does not open
properly, forcing the right ventricle to work harder. In
aortic stenosis, the improperly formed aortic valve is nar-
rowed. As the left ventricle works harder to pump blood
through the body, it becomes enlarged. In coarctation of
the aorta, the aorta is constricted, reducing the flow of
blood to the lower part of the body and increasing blood
pressure in the upper body.
A bicuspid aortic valve has only two flaps instead
of three, which can lead to stenosis in adulthood.
Subaortic stenosis is a narrowing of the left ventricle
below the aortic valve, that limits the flow of blood from
the left ventricle.

ual can also become infected by inhaling and swallowing
the eggs, for example, when the bedcovers are shaken.
Many individuals with enterobiasis exhibit no symp-
toms. When present, however, symptoms of the infection
begin approximately two weeks after ingesting the pin-
worm eggs. The main symptom is itching around the
anus. Because the itching intensifies at night, when the
female worms comes to the anus to lay eggs, it often
leads to disrupted sleep and irritability. Poor sleeping at
night in small children can be related to pinworms. Occa-
sionally, the itching causes some bleeding and bruising
in the region, and secondary bacterial infections can
occur. In females, the itching may spread to the vagina
and sometimes causes an infection of the vaginal region
(vaginitis). Enterobiasis usually lasts one to two months.

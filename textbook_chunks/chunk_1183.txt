A cardiac blood pool scan is sometimes called
equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography or gated
(synchronized) cardiac blood pool imaging. A multi-
ple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan is a variation of
this test.
To perform a cardiac blood pool scan, the patient
lies under a special gamma scintillation camera that
detects radiation. A protein tagged with a radioactive
marker (usually technetium-99m) is injected into the
patientâ€™s forearm.
The camera is synchronized with an electrocardio-
gram (ECG) to take a picture at specific times in the
cycle of heart contraction and relaxation. When data
from many sequential pictures is processed by a comput-
er, a doctor can analyze whether the left ventricle is func-
tioning normally.
The patient needs to remain silent and motionless
during the test. Sometimes the patient is asked to exer-
cise, then another set of pictures is taken for comparison.
This test normally takes about 30 minutes.

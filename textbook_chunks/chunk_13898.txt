more hours per day had approximately half the incidence
of hip fractures as those who exercised fewer than 30
minutes per day or not at all.
Fractures can be prevented if safety measures are
taken seriously. These measures include using seat belts
in cars and encouraging children to wear protective
sports gear. Estrogen replacement for women past the
age of 50 has been shown to help prevent osteoporosis
and the fractures that may result from this condition. In
one study, elderly women on estrogen replacement thera-
py demonstrated the lowest occurrence of hip fractures
when compared to similar women not on estrogen
replacement therapy.

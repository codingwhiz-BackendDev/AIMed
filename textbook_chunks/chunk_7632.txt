Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by gradual
death of brain cells. The loss of cognitive abilities that
occurs with dementia leads to impairments in memory,
reasoning, planning, and personality. While the over-
whelming number of people with dementia are elderly, it
is not an inevitable part of aging. Instead, dementia is
caused by specific brain diseases. Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) is the most common cause, followed by vascular or
multi-infarct dementia.
The prevalence of dementia has been difficult to
determine, partly because of differences in definition
among different studies, and partly because there is some
normal decline in functional ability with age. Dementia
affects 5–8% of all people between ages 65 and 74, and
up to 20% of those between 75 and 84. Estimates for
dementia in those 85 and over range from 30–47%.
Between two and four million Americans have AD; that
number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million by
the middle of the twenty-first century as the population
as a whole ages.
The cost of dementia can be considerable. While
most people with dementia are retired and do not suffer
income losses from their disease, the cost of care is often
enormous. Financial burdens include lost wages for fam-
ily caregivers, medical supplies and drugs, and home
modifications to ensure safety. Nursing home care may
cost several thousand dollars a month or more. The psy-
chological cost is not as easily quantifiable but can be
even more profound. The person with dementia loses
control of many of the essential features of his life and
personality, and loved ones lose a family member even as
they continue to cope with the burdens of increasing
dependence and unpredictability.

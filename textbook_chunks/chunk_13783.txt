At a certain age children will eat anything. A very
partial list of items recovered from young stomachs
includes the following: Coins, chicken bones, fish bones,
beads, rocks, plastic toys, pins, keys, round stones, mar-
bles, nails, rings, batteries, ball bearings, screws, staples,
washers, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toy
soldier. Some of these items will pass right on through
and come out the other end. The progress of metal objects
has been successfully followed with a metal detector.
Others, like sharp bones, can get stuck and cause trouble.
Batteries are corrosive and must be removed immediately.
Children eat things and stick things into their bodily
openings of their own volition. But they inhale them
unwittingly. The most commonly inhaled item is probably
a peanut. A crayon and a cockroach have been found in a
childâ€™s windpipes. These items always cause symptoms
(difficulty swallowing and spitting up saliva, for instance)
and may elude detection for some time while the child is
being treated for asthma or recurring pneumonia.
Adults are not exempt from unorthodox inedibles.
Dental devices are commonly swallowed. Adults with
mental illness or subversive motives may swallow inap-
propriate objects, such as toothbrushes.

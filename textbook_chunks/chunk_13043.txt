Alternative treatments for breast fibroadenomas
include a low-fat, high-fiber, vegetarian-type diet; a
reduction in caffeine intake; supplementation with
evening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis), flax oil, or
fish oil and vitamins E and C; and the application of hot
compresses to the breast. In addition, a focus on liver
cleansing is important to assist the body in conjugation
and elimination of excess estrogens. Botanical remedies
can be useful in hormone balancing, as can acupunc-
ture and homeopathy. Massaging the breasts with cas-
tor oil, straight or infused with herbs or essential oils,
can help fibroadenomas reduce and dissipate, as well as
keep women in touch with changes in their breast tissue.

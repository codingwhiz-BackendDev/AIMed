Chest physical therapy can be performed in a variety
of settings including critical care units, hospitals, nursing
homes, outpatient clinics, and at the patient’s home.
Depending on the circumstances, chest physical therapy
may be performed by anyone from a respiratory care ther-
apist to a trained member of the patient’s family. Different
patient conditions warrant different levels of training.
Chest physical therapy consists of a variety of proce-
dures that are applied depending on the patient’s health
and condition. Hospitalized patients are reevaluated fre-
quently to establish which procedures are most effective
and best tolerated. Patients receiving long term chest phys-
ical therapy are reevaluated about every three months.

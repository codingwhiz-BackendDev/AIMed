Coccidioidomycosis is an airborne infection. The
fungus that causes the disease is found in the dry desert
soil of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Cen-
tral and South America. Coccidioidomycosis is some-
times called San Joaquin fever, valley fever, or desert
fever because of its prevalence in the farming valleys of
California. Although commonly acquired, overt coccid-
ioidomycosis is a rare disease. Chronic infections occur
in only one out of every 100,000 people.
Although anyone can get coccidioidomycosis, farm
laborers, construction workers, and archaeologists who
work where it is dusty are at greater risk to become
infected. People of any age can get coccidioidomycosis,
but the disease most commonly occurs in the 25â€“55 age
group. In its acute form, coccidioidomycosis infects men
and women equally.
Chronic and disseminated forms of coccidioidomy-
cosis occur more frequently in men and pregnant women.
Although it is not clear why, people of color are 10-20
times more likely to develop the disseminated form of
the disease than caucasians. People who have a weak-
ened immune system (immunocompromised), either
from diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result
of medications that suppressed the immune system (cor-
ticosteroids, chemotherapy), are more likely to develop
disseminated coccidioidomycosis.

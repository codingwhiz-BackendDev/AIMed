Body fluids or tissues can be tested to reveal CMV
infection. However, this information is not always partic-
ularly helpful because CMV stays dormant in the cells
for life. Tests to look for special immune cells (antibod-
ies) directed specifically against CMV are useful in prov-
ing that a person has been infected with CMV. However,
these tests do not give any information regarding when
the CMV infection first occurred.

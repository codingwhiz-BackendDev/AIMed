Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a nervous system
disease caused by eating cooked or raw shellfish that con-
tain environmental toxins. These toxins are produced by a
group of algae (dinoflagellates). It is unclear whether these
toxins are related to the “blooming” of the algae, also
called red tide because the algae can turn the water reddish
brown. PSP occurs mostly in May through November.

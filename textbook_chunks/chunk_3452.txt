The recommended dosage depends on the type of
cholesterol-reducing drug used. The prescribing physi-
cian or the pharmacist who filled the prescription can
advise about the correct dosage.
Cholesterol-reducing drugs should be taken exactly
as directed and doses should not be missed. Double
doses should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.
Physicians may prescribe a combination of choles-
terol-reducing drugs, such as pravastatin and colestipol.
Following the directions for how and when to take the
drugs is very important. The medicine may not work
properly if both drugs are taken at the same time of day.
Niacin should not be taken at the same time as an
HMG-CoA inhibitor, as this combination may cause
severe muscle problems. If niacin is taken in an over-the-
counter form, both the prescribing physician and phar-
macist should be informed. There are no problems when
the niacin is taken in normal doses as a vitamin.
The prescription should not be stopped without first
checking with the physician who prescribed it. Choles-
terol levels may increase when the medicine is stopped,
and the physician may prescribe a special diet to make
this less likely.

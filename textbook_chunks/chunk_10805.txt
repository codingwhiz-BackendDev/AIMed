In a man without symptoms whose prostate is
enlarged, it is hard to predict when urinary symptoms
will develop and how rapidly they will progress. For this
reasons some specialists (urologists) advise a period of
“watchful waiting.” When BPH is treated by convention-
al TUR, there is a small risk of complications but, in the
great majority of men, urinary symptoms will be relieved
and their quality of life will be much enhanced. In the
future, it is possible that the less invasive forms of surgi-
cal treatment will be increasingly used to achieve results
as good as those of the standard operation. It also is pos-
sible that new medications will be developed that shrink
the prostate and eliminate obstructive symptoms so that
surgery can be avoided altogether.

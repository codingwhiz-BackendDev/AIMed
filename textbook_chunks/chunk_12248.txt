If there is an underlying physical reason for failure
to thrive, such as a disorder of swallowing mechanism or
intestinal problems, correcting that problem should

ronmental factors, the physician will suggest several
ways parents may provide adequate food for the child.
Maternal education and parental counseling may also be
recommended. In extreme cases, hospitalization or a
more nurturing home may be necessary.

The prognosis for choriocarcinomas in the uterus is
very good. Although these tumors have often spread
throughout the body, chemotherapy results in a cure or
remission in at least 80–90% of cases. Women who have
had choriocarcinomas often go on to have normal preg-
nancies and deliveries.
Choriocarcinomas in other sites have a poorer prog-
nosis. These tumors tend to spread quickly and don’t
always respond well to chemotherapy. Although treat-
ment can be effective, the outcome usually depends on
how widely the cancer is dispersed. Generally, the prog-
nosis is worse if the cancer can be found in the liver or
brain, if hCG levels are high, or if the original tumor
developed outside the gonads. Five-year survival with
testicular cancers can range from 92% for tumors that
have spread only to the lungs to 48% to tumors that have
spread to other internal organs.

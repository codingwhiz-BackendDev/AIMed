Prior to 1980, hypercholesterolemia (an abnormal-
ly high TC level) was defined as any value above the
95th percentile for the population. These figures ranged
from 210 mg/dL in persons younger than 20 to more than
280 mg/dL in persons older than 60. It is now known,
however, that TC levels over 200 mg/dL are associated
with significantly higher risk of CAD. Levels of 280
mg/dL or more are considered elevated. Treatment with
diet and medication has proven to successfully lower risk
of heart attack and stroke.
Elevated cholesterol levels may also result from
hepatitis, blockage of the bile ducts, disorders of lipid
metabolism, nephrotic syndrome, inflammation of the
pancreas, or hypothyroidism.

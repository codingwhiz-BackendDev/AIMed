Definition
An electrophysiology (EP) study of the heart is a
nonsurgical analysis of the electrical conduction system
(normal or abnormal) of the heart. The test employs car-
diac catheters and sophisticated computers to generate
electrocardiogram (EKG) tracings and electrical mea-
surements with exquisite precision from within the heart
chambers.
The EP study can be performed solely for diagnostic
purposes. It also is performed to pinpoint the exact loca-
tion of electrical signals (cardiac mapping) in conjunction
with a therapeutic procedure called catheter ablation.
The test is simple, not painful, and performed in a
special laboratory under controlled clinical circum-
stances by cardiologists and nurses who subspecialize in
electrophysiology.

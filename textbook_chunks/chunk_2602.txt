been displaced because of injury. Herniated disks are the
cause of only a small proportion of cases of lower back
pain, and chemonucleolysis is appropriate for only some
cases of HNP.
Chemonucleolysis is a conservative alternative to
disk surgery. There are three types of disk injuries. A
protruded disk is one that is intact but bulging. In an
extruded disk, the fibrous wrapper has torn and the NP
has oozed out, but is still connected to the disk. In a
sequestered disk, a fragment of the NP has broken loose
from the disk and is free in the spinal canal. Chemonu-
cleolysis is effective on protruded and extruded disks,
but not on sequestered disk injuries. In the United
States, chymopapain chemonucleolysis is approved
only for use in the lumbar (lower) spine. In other coun-
tries, it has also been used successfully to treat cervical
(upper spine) hernias.
Other indications that a patient is a good candidate
for chemonucleolysis instead of surgery include:
• the patient is 18–50 years of age
• leg pain is worse than lower back pain
• other conservative treatments have failed
• the spot where the herniated disk presses on the nerve
has been pinpointed by myelography, computed
tomography scan (CT scan), or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI)
• the patient wishes to avoid surgery

FASTING GLUCOSE TEST. Blood is drawn from a vein
in the patientâ€™s arm after a period at least eight hours when
the patient has not eaten, usually in the morning before
breakfast. The red blood cells are separated from the sam-
ple and the amount of glucose is measured in the remain-
ing plasma. A plasma level of 7.8 mmol/L (200 mg/L) or
greater can indicate diabetes. The fasting glucose test is
usually repeated on another day to confirm the results.
POSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE TEST. Blood is taken right
after the patient has eaten a meal.
ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST. Blood samples are
taken from a vein before and after a patient drinks a thick,
sweet syrup of glucose and other sugars. In a non-diabet-
ic, the level of glucose in the blood goes up immediately
after the drink and then decreases gradually as insulin is
used by the body to metabolize, or absorb, the sugar. In a
diabetic, the glucose in the blood goes up and stays high
after drinking the sweetened liquid. A plasma glucose
level of 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) or higher at two hours
after drinking the syrup and at one other point during the
two-hour test period confirms the diagnosis of diabetes.

Few symptoms in medicine present such a diagnos-
tic challenge as fever. Nonetheless, if a careful, logical,
and thorough evaluation is performed, a diagnosis will be
found in most cases. The patientâ€™s past medical history as
well as travel, social, and family history should be care-
fully searched for important clues.
Usually the first step is to search for an infectious
cause. Skin and other screening tests for diseases such as
tuberculosis, and examination of blood, urine, and stool,
are generally indicated. Antibody levels to a number of
infectious agents can be measured; if these are rising,
they may point to an active infection.
Various x-ray studies are also of value. In addition to
standard examinations, recently developed radiological
techniques using ultrasound, computed tomography scan
(CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
are now available. These enable physicians to examine
areas that were once accessible only through surgery. Fur-
thermore, new studies using radioactive materials (nuclear
medicine), can detect areas of infection and inflammation
previously almost impossible to find, even with surgery.
Biopsies of any suspicious areas found on an x-ray
exam can be performed by either traditional or newer
surgical techniques. Material obtained by biopsy is then
examined by a pathologist to look for clues as to the
cause of the fever. Evidence of infection, tumor or other
diseases can be found in this way. Portions of the biopsy
are also sent to the laboratory for culture in an attempt to
grow and identify an infectious organism.
Patients with HIV are an especially difficult prob-
lem, as they often suffer from many unusual infections.
HIV itself is a potential cause of fever.

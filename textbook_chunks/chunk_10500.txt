Most biopsies are done to rule out endometrial cancer
or endometrial hyperplasia. A normal result shows no can-
cerous or precancerous cells. Normal results also show
that the uterine lining is changing at the proper rate. If it is,
then the results of the biopsy are said to be “in-phase”
because the tissue looks appropriate and has developed
normally for the late phase of the menstrual cycle.

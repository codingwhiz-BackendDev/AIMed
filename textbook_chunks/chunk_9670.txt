Treatment of edema is based on the cause. Simple
steps to lessen fluid build-up may include:
• Reducing sodium intake. A high sodium level causes or
aggravates fluid retention.
• Maintaining proper weight. Being overweight slows
body fluid circulation and puts extra pressure on the
veins.
• Exercise. Regular exercise stimulates circulation.
• Elevation of the legs. Placing the legs at least 12 in
(30.5 cm) above the level of the heart for 10–15 min-
utes, three to four times a day, stimulates excess fluid
re-entry into the circulatory system.
• Use of support stocking. Elastic stockings, available at
most medical supply or drug stores, will compress the
leg vessels, promoting circulation and decreasing pool-
ing of fluid due to gravity.

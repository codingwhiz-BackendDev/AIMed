Because TENS may interfere with pacemaker func-
tion, patients with pacemakers should consult a cardiol-
ogist before using a TENS unit. Patients should also
avoid electrical stimulation in the front of the neck,
which can be hazardous. The safety of the device during
pregnancy has not been established.
TENS doesnâ€™t cure any condition; it simply eases
pain. Patients who are not sure what is causing their pain
should consult a physician before using TENS.

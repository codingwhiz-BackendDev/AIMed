The purpose of eye muscle surgery is generally to
align the pair of eyes so that they gaze in the same direc-
tion and move together as a team, either to improve
appearance or to aid in the development of binocular
vision in a young child. To achieve binocular vision, the
goal is to align the eyes so that the location of the image
on the retina of one eye corresponds to the location of the
image on the retina of the other eye.
In addition, sometimes eye muscle surgery can help
people with other eye disorders (nystagmus and Duane
syndrome, for example).

Congenital brain defects may have genetic, infec-
tious, toxic, or traumatic causes. In most cases, no certain
cause can be identified.
GENETIC CAUSES. Some brain defects are caused by
trisomy, the inclusion of a third copy of a chromosome
normally occurring in pairs. Most trisomies occur
because of improper division of the chromosomes during
formation of eggs or sperm. Trisomy of chromosome 9
can cause some cases of Dandy-Walker and Chiari II
malformation. Some cases of holoprosencephaly are
caused by trisomy of chromosome 13, while others are
due to abnormalities in chromosomes 7 or 18. Individual
gene defects, either inherited or spontaneous, are respon-
sible for other cases of congenital brain malformations.
DRUGS. Drugs known to cause congenital brain
defects when used by the mother during critical develop-
mental periods include:
• anticonvulsant drugs
• retinoic acid and tretinoin
• warfarin
• alcohol
• cocaine
OTHER. Other causes of congenital brain defects
include:
• intrauterine infections, including cytomegalovirus,
rubella, herpes simplex, and varicella zoster
• maternal diabetes mellitus
• maternal phenylketonuria
• fetal trauma

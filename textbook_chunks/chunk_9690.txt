Humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
Chromosomes are numbered 1–22, and the 23rd pair is
composed of the sex chromosomes, X and Y. A person
inherits one set of 23 chromosomes from each parent.
Occasionally, a genetic error occurs during egg or
sperm cell formation. A child conceived with such an
egg or sperm cell may inherit an incorrect number of
chromosomes.
In the case of Edwards’ syndrome, the child inherits
three, rather than two, copies of chromosome 18. Trisomy
18 occurs in approximately one in every 3,000 newborns
and affects girls more often than boys. Women older than
their early thirties have a greater risk of conceiving a child
with trisomy 18, but it can occur in younger women.

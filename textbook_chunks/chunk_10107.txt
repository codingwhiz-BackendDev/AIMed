The interpretation of EMG results is not a simple
matter, requiring analysis of the onset, duration, ampli-
tude, and other characteristics of the spike patterns.
Electrical activity at rest is abnormal; the particular
pattern of firing may indicate denervation (for example, a
nerve lesion, radiculopathy, or lower motor neuron
degeneration), myotonia, or inflammatory myopathy.
Decreases in the amplitude and duration of spikes
are associated with muscle diseases, which also show
faster recruitment of other muscle fibers to compensate
for weakness. Recruitment is reduced in nerve disorders.

ical problems. People with mild cerebral palsy may have
near-normal lifespans, but the lifespan of those with
more severe forms may be shortened. However, over
90% of infants with CP survive into adulthood.
The cause of most cases of CP remains unknown,
but it has become clear in recent years that birth difficul-
ties are not to blame in most cases. Rather, developmen-
tal problems before birth, usually unknown and generally
undiagnosable, are responsible for most cases. The rate
of survival for preterm infants has leveled off in recent
years, and methods to improve the long-term health of
these at-risk babies are now being sought. Current
research is also focusing on the possible benefits of rec-
ognizing and treating coagulopathies and inflammatory
disorders in the prenatal and perinatal periods. The use of
magnesium sulfate in pregnant women with preeclamp-
sia or threatened preterm delivery may reduce the risk of
CP in very preterm infants. Finally, the risk of CP can be
decreased through good maternal nutrition, avoidance
of drugs and alcohol during pregnancy, and prevention or
prompt treatment of infections.

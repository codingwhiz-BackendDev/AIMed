ment) and placenta (a spongy structure that lines the uterus
and nourishes the developing organism).
In a tubal ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg can-
not make it all the way down the tube because of scarring
or obstruction. The fallopian tube is too narrow for the
growing zygote. Eventually the thin walls of the tube
stretch and may burst (rupture), resulting in severe bleed-
ing and possibly the death of the mother. More than 95%
percent of all ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian
tube. Only 1.5% develop in the abdomen; less than 1%
develop in the ovary or the cervix.

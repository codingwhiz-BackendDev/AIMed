Immunotherapy uses the body’s own immune sys-
tem to destroy cancer cells. This form of treatment is
being intensively studied in clinical trials and is not yet
widely available to most cancer patients. The various
immunological agents being tested include substances
produced by the body (such as the interferons, inter-
leukins, and growth factors), monoclonal antibodies and
vaccines. Unlike traditional vaccines, cancer vaccines do
not prevent cancer. Instead, they are designed to treat
people who already have the disease. Cancer vaccines
work by boosting the body’s immune system and training
the immune cells to specifically destroy cancer cells.

The cause of esophageal atresia, like that of most
birth defects, is unknown.
An infant born with this defect will at first appear all
right, swallowing normally. However, the blind pouch
will begin to fill with mucus and saliva that would nor-
mally pass through the esophagus to the stomach. These
secretions back up into the mouth and nasal area, causing
the baby to drool excessively. When fed, the baby will
also immediately regurgitate what he or she has eaten.
Choking and coughing may also occur as the baby
breaths in the fluid backing up from the esophagus. Aspi-
ration pneumonia, an infection of the respiratory system
caused by inhalation of the contents of the digestive tract,
may also develop.

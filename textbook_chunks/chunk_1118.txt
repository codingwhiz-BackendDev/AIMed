The symptoms of CO poisoning in order of increas-
ing severity include:
• headache
• shortness of breath
• dizziness
• fatigue
• mental confusion and difficulty thinking
• loss of fine hand-eye coordination
• nausea and vomiting
• rapid heart rate
• hallucinations
• inability to execute voluntary movements accurately
• collapse
• lowered body temperature (hypothermia)
• coma
• convulsions
• seriously low blood pressure
• cardiac and respiratory failure
• death
In some cases, the skin, mucous membranes, and
nails of a person with CO poisoning are cherry red or
bright pink. Because the color change doesn’t always
occur, it is an unreliable symptom to rely on for diagnosis.
Although most CO poisoning is acute, or sudden, it is
possible to suffer from chronic CO poisoning. This condi-
tion exists when a person is exposed to low levels of the gas
over a period of days to months. Symptoms are often vague
and include (in order of frequency) fatigue, headache,
dizziness, sleep disturbances, cardiac symptoms, apathy,
nausea, and memory disturbances. Little is known about
chronic CO poisoning, and it is often misdiagnosed.

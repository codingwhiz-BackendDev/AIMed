There are many different types of chemotherapy
drugs. Oncologists, doctors who specialize in treating
cancer, determine which drugs are best suited for
each patient. This decision is based on the type of
cancer, the patientâ€™s age and health, and other drugs
the patient is taking. Some patients should not be
treated with certain chemotherapy drugs. Age and
other conditions may affect the drugs with which a
person may be treated. Heart disease, kidney disease,
and diabetes are conditions that may limit the choice
of treatment drugs.

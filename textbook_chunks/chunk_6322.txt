The human equivalent of mad cow
disease?
From the beginning of the BSE epidemic, scientists
and others in Britain feared that BSE might jump species
again to infect humans who had consumed infected beef.
This, however, had never occurred in scrapie from sheep,
a disease known from hundreds of years. In 1996, the
first report of this possibility occurred and this fear
seemed to be realized with the first cases of a new variant
of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, termed nvCJD, now just
vCJD. Its victims are much younger than the 60–65 year
old average for CJD, and the time from symptom onset to
death has averaged 12 months or more instead of eight.
The disease appears to cause more psychiatric symptoms
early on. EEG abnormalities characteristic of CJD are
not typically seen in vCJD.
As of July 2001, the total number of human cases of
vCJD is 102. It is of major concern that the number of
cases per year seems to be increasing by a factor of 1.35
each year. Almost all the cases have been found in Great
Britain with three in France, one in Ireland, and one sus-
pected in Hong Kong (who spent time in Great Britain).

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Evidence is growing stronger that vCJD is in fact
caused by BSE:
• almost all of the cases so far have occurred in Great
Britain, the location of the BSE epidemic.
• BSE injected into monkeys produces a disease very
similar to vCJD
• BSE and vCJD produce the same brain lesions after the
same incubation period when injected into laboratory
mice
• brain proteins isolated from vCJD victims, but not from
the other forms of CJD, share similar molecular charac-
teristics with brain proteins of animals that died from

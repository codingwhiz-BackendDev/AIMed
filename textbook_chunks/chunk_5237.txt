The ureter drains urine from the kidney into the
bladder. It is not simply a tube but an active organ that
propels urine forward by muscular action. It has a valve
at its bottom end that prevents urine from flowing back-
ward into the kidney. Normally, there is one ureter on
each side of the body for each kidney. However, among
the many abnormalities of ureteral development, duplica-
tion is quite common. Ureters may also be malformed in
a variety of waysâ€”some harmful, others not.

Bleeding is the biggest risk for ECMO patients,
since blood thinners are given to guard against blood
clots. Bleeding can occur anywhere in the body, but is
most serious when it occurs in the brain. This is why
doctors periodically perform ultrasound brain scans of
anyone on ECMO. Stroke, which may be caused by
bleeding or blood clots in the brain, has occurred in some
patients undergoing ECMO.
If bleeding becomes a problem, the patient may
require frequent blood transfusions or operations to con-
trol the bleeding. If the bleeding canâ€™t be stopped,
ECMO will be withdrawn.
Other risks include infection or vocal cord injury.
Some patients develop severe blood infections that cause
irreversible damage to vital organs.

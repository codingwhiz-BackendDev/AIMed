HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA. Skeletal fractures or dis-
ease, kidney failure, hypoparathyroidism, hemodialy-
sis, diabetic ketoacidosis, acromegaly, systemic infec-
tion, and intestinal obstruction can all cause phosphate
retention and build-up in the blood. The disorder occurs
concurrently with hypocalcemia. Individuals with mild
hyperphosphatemia are typically asymptomatic, but
signs of severe hyperphosphatemia include:
• tingling in hands and fingers
• muscle spasms and cramps
• convulsions
• cardiac arrest
HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA. Serum phosphate levels of 2
mg/dL or below may be caused by hypomagnesemia and
hypokalemia. Severe burns, alcoholism, diabetic ketoaci-
dosis, kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism, hypothy-
roidism, Cushing’s syndrome, malnutrition, hemodialy-
sis, vitamin D deficiency, and prolonged diuretic therapy
can also diminish blood phosphate levels. There are typi-
cally few physical signs of mild phosphate depletion.

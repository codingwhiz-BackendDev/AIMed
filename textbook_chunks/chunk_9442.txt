is drilled away, and a skin graft is placed in the ear canal.
If the tumor is near the eardrum, the skin of the ear canal
and the eardrum are removed along with the bone sur-
rounding the ear canal. A skin graft is placed on the bare
bone. For basal cell cancers and low grade glandular
malignancies, surgical resection of the ear canal is ade-
quate. Squamous cell carcinoma, a serious form of can-
cer, of the external ear canal requires radical surgery, fol-
lowed by radiation therapy. Cholesteatoma, a benign
tumor caused by an infection in a perforated eardrum that
did not heal properly and can destroy the bones of hear-
ing, is removed with microsurgery. Mastoidectomy is
performed for mastoiditis, an inflammation of the mid-
dle ear, if medical therapy does not work. Petrous apicec-
tomy is performed to drain the petrous apicitis, the bone
between the middle ear and the clivis.

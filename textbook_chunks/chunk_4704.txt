Occasionally, patients may have bleeding or infec-
tion after biopsy. Bleeding is usually controlled with a
topical medication.
A patient should call her doctor right away if she
notices any of the following symptoms:
• heavy vaginal bleeding (more than one sanitary pad an
hour)
• fever, chills, or an unpleasant vaginal odor
• lower abdominal pain.

• prolonged coughing

Sometimes fainting may be caused by a temporary
drop in the blood supply to the brain caused by a tran-
sient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA, sometimes called a
mini-stroke, is a disruption in the blood supply to the
brain caused by a blocked or burst blood vessel. Seek
help immediately if a fainting spell is followed by one or
more of the symptoms listed below:
• numbness or tingling in any body part
• blurred vision
• confusion
• difficulty speaking
• loss of movement in arms or legs
A few seconds before fainting, a person may sweat
or become pale, feel nauseated or dizzy, and have blurred
vision or racing heartbeat. Once the person loses con-
sciousness, the pupils may dilate as the heart rate slows
down. There may be abnormal movements. Muscles may
tighten or the back may arch. These movements do not
last long and they are not violent.
In most cases, the patient regains consciousness
within a few minutes, but the fainting spell may be fol-
lowed by nervousness, headache, nausea, dizziness, pal-
lor or sweating. The person may faint again, especially if
he or she stands up within 30 minutes.

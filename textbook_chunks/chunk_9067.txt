In preparing for this test, the following guidelines
should be observed:
• Depending on the drug to be tested, the physician
should decide if the patient is to be fasting (nothing
to eat or drink for a specified period of hours) before
the test.
• For patients suspected of symptoms of drug toxicity,
the best time to draw the blood specimen is when the
symptoms are occurring.
• If there is a question as to whether an adequate dose of
the drug is being achieved, it is best to obtain trough
(lowest therapeutic concentration) levels.
• Peak (highest concentration) levels are usually obtained
one to two hours after oral intake, approximately one
hour after intramuscular (IM) administration (a shot in
the muscle), and approximately 30 minutes after intra-
venous (IV) administration. Residual, or trough, levels
are usually obtained within 15 minutes of the next
scheduled dose.

• The child’s fever goes above 102°F (38.9°C) or takes
more than four days to disappear.
• The child’s blisters appear infected. Signs of infection
include leakage of pus from the blisters or excessive
redness, warmth, tenderness, or swelling around the
blisters.
• The child seems nervous, confused, unresponsive, or
unusually sleepy; complains of a stiff neck or severe
headache; shows signs of poor balance or has trouble
walking; finds bright lights hard to look at; is having
breathing problems or is coughing a lot; is complaining
of chest pain; is vomiting repeatedly; or is having con-
vulsions. These may be signs of Reye’s syndrome or
encephalitis, two rare but potentially very dangerous
conditions.

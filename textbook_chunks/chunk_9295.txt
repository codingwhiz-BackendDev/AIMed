Many successful and even famous people have
dyslexia. How well a person with dyslexia functions in
life depends on the way the disability affects that person.
There is a great deal of variation among different people
with dyslexia, producing different symptoms and differ-
ent degrees of severity.
Prognosis is usually good if the condition is diag-
nosed early, and if the person has a strong self image
with supportive family, friends, and teachers. It is imper-
ative for a good outcome that the person be involved in a
good remedial program.

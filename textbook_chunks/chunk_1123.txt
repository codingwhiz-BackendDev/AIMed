The main reason to suspect CO poisoning is evidence
that fuel is being burned in a confined area, for example a
car running inside a closed garage, a charcoal grill burn-
ing indoors, or an unvented kerosene heater in a work-
shop. Under these circumstances, one or more persons
suffering from the symptoms listed above strongly sug-
gests CO poisoning. In the absence of some concrete rea-
son to suspect CO poisoning, the disorder is often misdi-
agnosed as migraine headache, stroke, psychiatric ill-
ness, food poisoning, alcohol poisoning, or heart disease.
Concrete confirmation of CO poisoning comes from
a carboxyhemoglobin test. This blood test measures the
amount of CO that is bound to hemoglobin in the body.
Blood is drawn as soon after suspected exposure to CO
as possible.
Other tests that are useful in determining the extent
of CO poisoning include measurement of other arterial
blood gases and pH; a complete blood count; measure-
ment of other blood components such as sodium, potassi-
um, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, and lactic acid; an elec-
trocardiogram (ECG); and a chest x ray.

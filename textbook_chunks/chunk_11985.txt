OPHTHALMOSCOPIC 
EXAM. The 
observations
include, but are not limited to the retina, blood vessels,
and optic nerve. The optic nerve enters the back of the
eye and can be checked for swelling or other problems.
The blood vessels can be viewed as can the retina. The
macula is a 3â€“5 mm area in the back of the eye and is
responsible for central vision. The fovea is a small area
located within the macula and is responsible for sharp
vision. When a person looks at something, they are
pointing the fovea at the object. Changes in the macular
area can be observed with the ophthalmoscope. Retinal
tears or detachments can also be seen.

reveals hydrops fetalis. If the baby is in danger, and the
pregnancy is at least 32–34 weeks along, labor is
induced. Under 32 weeks, the baby is given blood trans-
fusions while still in the mother’s uterus.
There are two techniques that are used to deliver a
blood transfusion to a baby before birth. In the first, a
needle is inserted through the mother’s abdomen and
uterus, and into the baby’s abdomen. Red blood cells
injected into the baby’s abdominal cavity are absorbed
into its bloodstream. In early pregnancy or if the baby’s
bilirubin levels are gravely high, cordocentesis is per-
formed. This procedure involves sliding a very fine nee-
dle through the mother’s abdomen and, guided by ultra-
sound, into a vein in the umbilical cord to inject red
blood cells directly into the baby’s bloodstream.
After birth, the severity of the baby’s symptoms are
assessed. One or more transfusions may be necessary to
treat anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and bleeding. Hyper-
bilirubinemia is also treated with phototherapy, a treat-
ment in which the baby is placed under a special light.
This light causes changes in how the bilirubin molecule
is shaped, which makes it easier to excrete. The baby
may also receive oxygen and intravenous fluids contain-
ing electrolytes or drugs to treat other symptoms.

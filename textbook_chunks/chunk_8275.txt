Frequently a flat, red rash is caused by simple chaf-
ing of the diaper against tender skin, initiating a friction
rash. This type of rash is not seen in the skin folds. It may
be more pronounced around the edges of the diaper, at
the waist and leg bands. The baby generally doesn’t
appear to experience much discomfort. Sometimes the
chemicals or detergents in the diaper are contributing
factors and may result in contact dermatitis. These
rashes should clear up easily with proper attention.
Ignoring the condition may lead to a secondary infection
that is more difficult to resolve.
Friction of skin against itself can cause a rash in the
baby’s skin folds, called intertrigo. This rash appears as
reddened areas that may ooze and is often uncomfortable
when the diaper is wet. Intertrigo can also be found on
other areas of the body where there are deep skin folds
that tend to trap moisture.
Seborrheic dermatitis is the diaper area equivalent
of cradle cap. It is scaly and greasy in appearance and
may be worse in the folds of the skin.
Yeast, or candidal dermatitis, is the most common
infectious cause of diaper rash. The affected areas are
raised and quite red with distinct borders, and satellite
lesions may occur around the edges. Yeast is part of the
normal skin flora, and is often an opportunistic invader
when simple diaper rash is untreated. It is particularly
common after treatment with antibiotics, which kill the
good bacteria that normally keep the yeast population in
check. Usual treatments for diaper rash will not clear it up.
Repeated or difficult to resolve episodes of yeast infection
may warrant further medical attention, since this is some-
times associated with diabetes or immune problems.
Another infectious cause of diaper rash is impetigo.
This bacterial infection is characterized by blisters that
ooze and crust.

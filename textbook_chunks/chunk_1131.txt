the gas. The half-life of CO in normal room air is four to
five hours. This means that, in four to five hours, half of
the CO bound to hemoglobin will be replaced with oxy-
gen. At normal atmospheric pressures, but breathing
100% oxygen, the half-life for the elimination of CO
from the body is 50-70 minutes. In hyperbaric therapy at
three atmospheres of pressure, the half-life is reduced to
20-25 minutes.
Although the symptoms of CO poisoning may sub-
side in a few hours, some patients show memory prob-
lems, fatigue, confusion, and mood changes for two to
four weeks after their exposure to the gas.

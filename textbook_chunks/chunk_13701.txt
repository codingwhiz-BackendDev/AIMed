Treatment of food poisoning, except that caused by
C. botulinum, focuses on preventing dehydration by
replacing fluids and electrolytes lost through vomiting
and diarrhea. Electrolytes are salts and minerals that
form electrically charges particles (ions) in body fluids.
Electrolytes are important because they control body
fluid balance and are important for all major body reac-
tions. Pharmacists can recommend effective, pleasant-
tasting, electrolytically balanced replacement fluids
that are available without a prescription. When more
fluids are being lost than can be consumed, dehydration
may occur. Dehydration more likely to happen in the
very young, the elderly, and people who are taking
diuretics. To prevent dehydration, a doctor may give
fluids intravenously.
In very serious cases of food poisoning, medications
may be given to stop abdominal cramping and vomiting.
Anti-diarrheal medications are not usually given. Stop-
ping the diarrhea keeps the toxins in the body longer and
may prolong the infection.
People with food poisoning should modify their diet.
During period of active vomiting and diarrhea they
should not try to eat and should drink only clear liquids
frequently but in small quantities. Once active symptoms
stop, they should eat bland, soft, easy to digest foods for
two to three days. One example is the BRAT diet of
bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, all of which are easy
to digest. Milk products, spicy food, alcohol and fresh
fruit should be avoided for a few days, although babies
should continue to breastfeed. These modifications are
often all the treatment that is necessary.
Severe bacterial food poisonings are sometimes
treated with antibiotics. Trimethoprim and sulfamethox-

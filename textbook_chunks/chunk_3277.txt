Hospital management of cholecystitis ends the symp-
toms for about 75% of all patients. Of these patients,
however, 25% will go on to have another attack of chole-
cystitis within a year, and 60% will have another attack
within six years. Each attack of cholecystitis increases a
patient’s risk of developing life-threatening complica-
tions, requiring risky emergency surgery. Therefore, early
removal of the gallbladder, rather than a “wait-and-see”
approach, is usually recommended. Cure is complete in
those patients who undergo cholecystectomy.

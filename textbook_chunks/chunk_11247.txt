With prompt treatment, the prognosis from erysi-
pelas is excellent. Delay of treatment, however, increases
the chance for bacteremia and the potential for death
from overwhelming sepsis. This is particularly true of
people with weakened immune systems (babies, the
elderly, and people ill with other diseases, especially
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS). Fre-
quently, an individual who has had erysipelas will have it
occur again in the same location.

During an EMG test, a fine needle is inserted into
the muscle to be tested. This may cause some discomfort,
similar to that of an injection. Recordings are made while
the muscle is at rest, and then during the contraction. The
person performing the test may move the limb being test-
ed, and direct the patient to move it with various levels of
force. The needle may be repositioned in the same mus-
cle for further recording. Other muscles may be tested as
well. A typical session lasts from 30â€“60 minutes.
A slightly different test, the nerve conduction veloci-
ty test, is often performed at the same time with the same
equipment. In this test, stimulating and recording elec-
trodes are used, and small electrical shocks are applied to
measure the ability of the nerve to conduct electrical sig-
nals. This test may cause mild tingling and discomfort

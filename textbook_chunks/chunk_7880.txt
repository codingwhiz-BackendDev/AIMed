In the 1950s and early 1960s, several drug compa-
nies claimed that DES (diethylstilbestrol) could prevent
miscarriages. DES is a synthetic hormone, related to
estrogen. Since up to 20% of all pregnancies end in mis-
carriage, this seemed like an important breakthrough
and DES was prescribed for many women who had
bleeding in early pregnancy. Ultimately, it was found to
have no effect on miscarriages and the practice of pre-
scribing DES was stopped in the 1960s. Almost 10 years
later, the daughters of women who had taken DES during
pregnancy began to develop unusual symptoms.
Doctors discovered that when these young women
reached their teens, they were at higher risk for a variety
of problems, including:
• clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix
• infertility
•premature labor and other problems in pregnancy

None

• Sodium (Na). A positively charged electrolyte that
helps to balance fluid levels in the body and facilitates
neuromuscular functioning.
• Potassium (K). A main component of cellular fluid, this
positive electrolyte helps to regulate neuromuscular
function and osmotic pressure.
• Calcium (Ca). A cation, or positive electrolyte, that
affects neuromuscular performance and contributes to
skeletal growth and blood coagulation.
• Magnesium (Mg). Influences muscle contractions and
intracellular activity. A cation.
• Chloride (CI). An anion, or negative electrolyte, that
regulates blood pressure.
• Phosphate (HPO4). Negative electrolyte that impacts
metabolism and regulates acid-base balance and calci-
um levels.
• Bicarbonate (HCO3). A negatively charged electrolyte
that assists in the regulation of blood pH levels. Bicar-
bonate insufficiencies and elevations cause acid-base
disorders (i.e., acidosis, alkalosis).
Medications, chronic diseases, and trauma (i.e.,
burns, fractures, etc.) may cause the concentration of
certain electrolytes in the body to become too high
(hyper-) or too low (hypo-). When this happens, an elec-
trolyte imbalance, or disorder, results.

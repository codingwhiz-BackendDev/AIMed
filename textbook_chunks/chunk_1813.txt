Physical symptoms, such as a fever and intense
backache or a fever, severe headache, and stiff neck, raise
the suspicion of a CNS infection. Blood tests may indi-
cate the presence of an infection but do not pinpoint its
location. CT scans or MRI scans of the brain and spine
can provide definitive diagnosis, with an MRI scan being
the most sensitive. A lumbar puncture and analysis of the
cerebrospinal fluid can help diagnose an epidural
abscess; however, the procedure can be dangerous in
cases of subdural empyema.

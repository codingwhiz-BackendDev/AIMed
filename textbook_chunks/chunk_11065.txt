Physicians and researchers distinguish between the
three major subtypes of EB based on which layer of the
epidermis separates from the deeper dermis layer of the
skin below. Patients suspected of having EB should have a
fresh blister biopsied for review. This sample of tissue is
examined under an electron microscope or under a con-
ventional microscope using a technique called immunoflu-
orescence, which helps to map the underlying structure.
Knowing that a family member has EB can help
establish the diagnosis, but it is possible that parents or
siblings will show no sign of the disease, either because
it is caused by a new genetic mutation, or because the
parents are carriers of the recessive trait and do not dis-
play the disease.

Cardiac catheterization provides valuable still and
motion x-ray pictures of the coronary arteries that help in
diagnosing coronary artery disease, poor heart function,
disease of the heart valves, and septal defects (a defect in
the septum, the wall that separates two heart chambers).
The most prominent sign of coronary artery disease
is the narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries,
with narrowing that is greater than 70% considered sig-
nificant. A clear indication for intervention (by angio-
plasty or surgery) is a finding of significant narrowing
of the left main coronary artery and/or blockage or
severe narrowing in the high, left anterior descending
coronary artery.

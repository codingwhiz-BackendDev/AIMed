None

Embryo—In humans, the developing organism
from conception until approximately the end of
the second month.
Fallopian tube—The tube that carries the egg from
the ovary to the uterus.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)—A hor-
mone excreted during the development of an
embryo or fetus.
Laparoscopy—Examination of the contents of the
abdominal cavity with a fiberoptic tube inserted
through a small incision.
Laparotomy—Surgical incision into the abdomen
to locate, repair, and/or remove injured or dis-
eased tissues.
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)—Acute or
chronic inflammation in the pelvic cavity, particu-
larly inflammation of the fallopian tubes (salpingi-
tis) and its complications.
Rupture—A breaking apart of an organ or tissue.
Salpingitis—Inflammation of the fallopian tube.
Tubal pregnancy—Pregnancy in one of the fallopi-
an tubes.
Zygote—The fertilized egg.
called a transducer, which emits high frequency sound
waves, is moved over the surface of the patient’s
abdomen or inserted into the vagina. The sound waves
bounce off of the internal organs and create an image on
a screen. The doctor should be able to see whether or not
there is a fetus developing in the uterus after at least five
weeks of gestation. Before that point, a normal pregnan-
cy is too small to see.
A culdocentesis may also help confirm a diagnosis.
In this procedure a needle is inserted into the space at the
top of the vagina, behind the uterus and in front of the
rectum. Blood in this area may indicate bleeding from a
ruptured fallopian tube.
A laparoscopy will enable the doctor to see the
patient’s reproductive organs and examine an ectopic
pregnancy. In this technique, a hollow tube with a light
on one end is inserted through a small incision in the
abdomen. Through this instrument the internal organs
can be observed.

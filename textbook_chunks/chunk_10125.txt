Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is performed late in preg-
nancy or continuously during labor to ensure normal deliv-
ery of a healthy baby. EFM can be utilized either externally
or internally in the womb.The illustration above shows the
internal procedure, in which an electrode is attached direct-
ly to the baby’s scalp to monitor the heart rate. Uterine con-
tractions are recorded using an intrauterine pressure
catheter which is inserted through the cervix into the
uterus. (Illustration by the Electronic Illustrators Group.)
feels that a baby may be at increased risk of problems
toward the end of pregnancy, a baby can be checked
every week or every other week with a non-stress test. In
this test, changes in the baby’s heart rate are measured
along with the fetus’ own movements. The heart rate of a
healthy baby should go up whenever she or he moves.
Fetal monitoring is used on and off during early
labor. As labor progresses, more monitoring is often
needed. Usually, as the time for delivery nears, the moni-
tor is left on continuously since the end of labor tends to
be the most stressful time for the baby.
A baby who is having trouble in labor will show char-
acteristic changes in heart rate after a contraction (late
decelerations). If a baby is not receiving enough oxygen to
withstand the stress of labor and delivery is many hours
away, a cesarean section (C-section) may be necessary.

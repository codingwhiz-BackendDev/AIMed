Most people will experience back pain at some time
in their lives. Injuries due to overexertion and poor pos-
ture are among the most common. Depending on the
cause and severity of the condition, options for treatment
may include physical therapy, rest, medications, surgery,
or chiropractic care. Chiropractic treatment carries none
of the risks of surgical or pharmacologic treatment. Prac-
titioners use a holistic approach to health, which is
appreciated by most patients. The goal is not merely to
relieve the present ailment, but to analyze the cause and
recommend appropriate changes of lifestyle to prevent
the problem from recurring again. They believe in a
risk/benefit analysis before use of any intervention. The
odds of an adverse outcome are extremely low. Chiro-
practic has proven in several studies to be less expensive
than many more traditional routes such as outpatient
physical therapy. Relief from some neuromuscular prob-
lems is immediate, although a series of treatments is like-
ly to be required to maintain the improvement. Spinal
manipulation is an excellent option for acute lower back
pain, and may also relieve neck pain as well as other
musculoskeletal pain. Although most back pain will sub-
side eventually with no treatment at all, chiropractic
treatment can significantly shorten the time it takes to get
relief. Some types of headache can also be successfully
treated by chiropractic.

Catecholamines is a collective term for the hormones
epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Manufac-
tured chiefly by the chromaffin cells of the adrenal
glands, these hormones are involved in readying the body
for the “fight-or-flight” response (also known as the alarm
reaction). When these hormones are released, the heart
beats stronger and faster, blood pressure rises, more blood
flows to the brain and muscles, the liver releases stores of
energy as a sugar the body can readily use (glucose), the
rate of breathing increases and airways widen, and diges-
tive activity slows. These reactions direct more oxygen
and fuel to the organs most active in responding to
stress—mainly the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles.

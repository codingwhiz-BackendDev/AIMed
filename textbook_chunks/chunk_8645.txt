One of the most common types of back surgery is
disk removal (diskectomy), the removal of an interverte-
bral disk, the flexible plate that connects any two adja-
cent vertebrae in the spine. Intervertebral disks act as
shock absorbers, protecting the brain and spinal cord
from the impact produced by the bodyâ€™s movements.

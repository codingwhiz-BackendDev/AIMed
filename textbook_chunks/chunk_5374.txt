If treated properly, the prognosis for conjunctivitis is
good. Conjunctivitis caused by an allergic reaction
should clear up once the allergen is removed. However,
allergic conjunctivitis will likely recur if the individual
again comes into contact with the particular allergen.
Conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or a virus, if treated
properly, is usually resolved in 10–14 days. If there is no
relief of symptoms in 48–72 hours, or there is moderate
to severe eye pain, changes in vision, or the conjunctivi-
tis is suspected to be caused by herpes simplex, a physi-
cian should be notified immediately. If untreated or if
treatment fails and is not corrected, conjunctivitis may
cause visual impairment by spreading to other parts of
the eye, such as the cornea.

A chest x ray can show fluid build-up and detect
other respiratory diseases. The perfusion lung scan shows
poor flow of blood in areas beyond blocked arteries. The
patient inhales a small amount of radiopharmaceutical
and pictures of airflow into the lungs are taken with a
gamma camera. Then a different radiopharmaceutical is
injected into an arm vein and lung blood flow is scanned.
A normal result essentially rules out a pulmonary
embolism. A lung scan can be performed in a hospital or
an outpatient facility and takes about 45 minutes.
Pulmonary angiography is the most reliable test for
diagnosing a pulmonary embolism but it is not used often
because it is expensive, invasive, and not readily available
in most hospitals. Pulmonary angiography is a radiographic
test which involves injection of a radio contrast agent to
show the pulmonary arteries. A cinematic camera records
the blood flow through the patient, who lies on a table. Pul-
monary angiography is usually performed in a hospital’s
radiology medicine department and takes 30–60 minutes.
An electrocardiograph shows the heart’s electrical
activity and helps distinguish a pulmonary embolism
from a heart attack. Electrodes covered with conducting
jelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs.
Impulses of the heart’s activity are traced on paper. The
test takes about 10 minutes.
Arterial blood gas measurements are sometimes
helpful but, alone, they are not diagnostic for pulmonary
embolism. Blood is taken from an artery instead of a
vein, usually in the wrist.
Venography is used to look for the most likely
source of a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis.
It is very accurate, but it is not used often, because it is
painful, expensive, exposes the patient to a fairly high
dose of radiation, and can cause complications. Venogra-

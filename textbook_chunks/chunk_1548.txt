Preventive measures emphasize protecting the eyes
from UV radiation by wearing glasses with a special coating
to protect against UV rays. Dark lenses alone are not suffi-
cient. The lenses must protect against UV light (specifically,
UV-A and UV-B). Antioxidants may also provide some pro-
tection by reducing free radicals that can damage lens pro-
teins. A healthy diet rich in sources of antioxidants, includ-
ing citrus fruits, sweet potatoes, carrots, green leafy vegeta-
bles, and/or vitamin supplements may be helpful. When tak-
ing certain medications, such as steroids, more frequent eye
exams may be necessary. Patients should speak to their doc-
tors to see if medications may affect their eyes.

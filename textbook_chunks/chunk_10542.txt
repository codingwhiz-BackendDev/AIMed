The decision to use radiation therapy depends on the
stage of the disease. Radiation therapy may be used
before surgery (preoperatively) and/or after surgery
(postoperatively). Radiation given from a machine that is
outside the body is called external radiation therapy.
Sometimes applicators containing radioactive com-
pounds are placed inside the vagina or uterus. This is
called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy and
requires hospitalization.
Side effects are common with radiation therapy. The
skin in the treated area may become red and dry.
Fatigue, upset stomach, diarrhea, and nausea are also
common complaints. Radiation therapy in the pelvic area
may cause the vagina to become narrow (vaginal steno-
sis), making intercourse painful. Premature menopause
and some problems with urination may also occur.

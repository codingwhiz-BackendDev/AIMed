Congenital—Present at birth.
Contrast agent—A chemical or other substance
placed in the body to show structures that would
not otherwise be visible on x ray or other imaging
studies.
Cystoscopy—Looking into the urinary bladder
with a thin telescope-like instrument.
Ectopic—Out of place.
Septicemia—A serious whole body infection
spreading through the blood stream.
Uretreovesical valve—A sphincter (an opening
controlled by a circular muscle), located where
the ureter enters the bladder, that keeps urine from
flowing backward toward the kidney.
Urogenital—Both the urinary system and the sex-
ual organs, which form together in the developing
embryo.
Practically the only symptom generated by ureteral
abnormalities is urinary tract infection. A lower tract
infection—in the bladder—is called cystitis. In children,
it may cause fever and systemic symptoms, but in adults
it causes only cloudy, burning, and frequent urine. Upper
tract infections, on the other hand, can be serious for both
adults and children, causing high fevers, back pain,
severe generalized discomfort, and even leading to kid-
ney failure or septicemia (infection spreading throughout
the body by way of the blood stream).
In rare cases, urine from an ectopic ureter will bypass
the bladder and dribble out of the bottom somewhere,
through a natural orifice like the vagina or a completely
separate unnatural opening.

A physician may consider the possibility of empye-
ma thoracis in patients with pneumonia or other symp-
toms of lung infection. When listening to sounds within
the patientâ€™s chest with a stethoscope, the sounds of
breathing will be partly muffled and harder to hear in the
patients with empyema. The area of the chest over the
infection will sound dull when tapped or thumped (per-
cussed). On an x ray, empyema thoracis will appear as a
cloudy or opaque area. The amount of fluid present in the
pleural cavity can be estimated using an ultrasound
imaging procedure. The diagnosis of empyema, however,
has to be confirmed with laboratory tests because its
symptoms can be caused by other disease conditions.
The diagnosis of empyema is usually confirmed by
analyzing a sample of fluid taken from the pleural cavity.
The sample is obtained by a procedure called thoracente-
sis. In this procedure, the patient is given a local anesthet-
ic, a needle is inserted into the pleural cavity through the
back between the ribs on the infected side, and a sample
of fluid is withdrawn. If the patient has empyema, there
will be a very high level of one particular kind of immune
cell (white blood cells), a high level of protein, and a very
low level of blood sugar. The fluid can also be tested for
the specific disease organism by staining or tissue cul-
tures. In some cases, the color, smell, or consistency of
the tissue fluid also helps to confirm the diagnosis.

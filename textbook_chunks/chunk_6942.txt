In homeopathic medicine, the symptoms of the disease
would be addressed to enhance the quality of life for the
person with cystic fibrosis. Treating the cause of CF,
because of the genetic basis for the disease, is not possible.
Homeopathic medicine seeks to treat the whole person,
however, and in CF, this approach might include:
• mucolytics to help thin mucous
• supplementation of pancreatic enzymes to assist in
digestion
• respiratory symptoms can be addressed to open lung
passages
• hydrotherapy techniques to help ease the respiratory
symptoms and help the body eliminate
• immune enhancements can help revent the develop-
ment of secondary infections
• dietary enhancements and adjustments are used to treat
digestive and nutritional problems

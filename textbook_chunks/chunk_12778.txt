The disorder typically affects up to 25 percent of all
American women, or an estimated 47 million women.
Three-fourths of women with FSAD are postmenopausal.
Women describe it as being “unable to get turned on,” or
being continually disinterested in sex. It is also called
“frigidity.” Other terms for the disorder include dyspareu-
nia and vaginismus, both of which involve pain during
intercourse.

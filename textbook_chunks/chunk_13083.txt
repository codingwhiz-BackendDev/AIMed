Breast cancer is the most common concern of
women who feel a breast lump or experience an abnor-
mal breast symptom. For peace of mind, and to rule out
any possibility of cancer, any newly discovered breast
lumps should be brought to the attention of a family
physician or an obstetrician-gynecologist. He or she will
obtain a history and conduct thorough physical exami-
nation of the area. Depending on the findings on physi-
cal examination, the patient is usually referred for tests.

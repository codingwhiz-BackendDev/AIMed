Surgery is necessary and can usually produce suc-
cessful results. If possible, the surgery must be done
within 48 hours of birth. Prior to surgery, the exposed
organs must be protected and all related defects identi-
fied and managed. Delay in the surgery leads to the
frequent need to divert the urine into the bowel
because the partially repaired bladder cannot control
the flow. After surgery, the likelihood of infection
requires monitoring.

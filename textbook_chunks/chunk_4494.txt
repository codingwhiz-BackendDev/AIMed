For those whose symptoms prompt them to visit
their physician, and if their symptoms could possibly be
related to colon cancer, the entire colon will be inspect-
ed. The combination of a flexible sigmoidoscopy and
DCBE may be performed but the preferred evaluation of
the entire colon and rectum is that of complete
colonoscopy. Colonoscopy allows direct visualization,
photography, and the opportunity to obtain a biopsy of
any abnormality visualized. If, for technical reasons, the
entire colon is not visualized endoscopically, a DCBE
should complement the colonoscopy.
The diagnosis of colon cancer is actually made by
the performance of a biopsy of any abnormal lesion in
the colon. When a tumor growth is identified, it could be
either a benign polyp (or lesion) or a cancer; the biopsy
resolves the issue. The endoscopist may take many sam-
ples so as to exclude any sampling errors.
If the patient presents with advanced disease, or has
advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, areas where
the tumor has spread (such as the liver) may be amenable
to biopsy. Such biopsies are usually obtained using a spe-
cial needle under local anesthesia.
Once a diagnosis of colon cancer has been estab-
lished by biopsy, in addition to the physical exam,
studies will be performed to assess the extent of the
disease. Blood studies include a complete blood
count, liver function tests, and a CEA. Imaging stud-
ies will include a chest x ray and a CAT scan (comput-
ed tomography scan) of the abdomen. The chest x ray
will determine if there is spread to the lung, and the
CAT scan will evaluate potential spread to the liver as
well as any local invasive characteristics of the primary
tumor. If the patient has any neurologic symptoms, a
CAT scan of the brain will be performed, and if the

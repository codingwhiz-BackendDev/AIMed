Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid
than it takes in. This condition can result from illness; a
hot, dry climate; prolonged exposure to sun or high tem-
peratures; not drinking enough water; and overuse of
diuretics or other medications that increase urination.
Dehydration can upset the delicate fluid-salt balance
needed to maintain healthy cells and tissues.
Water accounts for about 60% of a man’s body
weight. It represents about 50% of a woman’s weight.
Young and middle-aged adults who drink when they’re
thirsty do not generally have to do anything more to
maintain their body’s fluid balance. Children need more
water because they expend more energy, but most chil-
dren who drink when they are thirsty get as much water
as their systems require.

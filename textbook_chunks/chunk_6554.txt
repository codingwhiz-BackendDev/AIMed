Cryptosporidia are normally passed in the feces of
infected persons and animals in the form of cysts. The
cysts can remain in the ground and water for months, and
when ingested produce symptoms after maturing in the
intestine and the bile ducts. When viewed under the
microscope, they appear as small bluish-staining round
bodies. Most common sources of infection are other
humans, water supplies, or reservoirs. These are contam-
inated by animals that defecate in these areas. An out-
break in Milwaukee in 1993 in which over 400,000 per-
sons were affected was traced to the cityâ€™s water supply.
Cysts of Cryptosporidia are extremely resistant to the
disinfectants that are commonly used in most water treat-
ment plants and are incompletely removed by filtration.
Most persons who experience significant symptoms
have an altered immune system, and suffer from diseases
such as AIDS and cancer. However, as shown in the
Milwaukee outbreak, even those with normal immunity
can experience symptoms.

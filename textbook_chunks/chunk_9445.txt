Congenital atresia, the absence of the external ear
canal, and congenital microtia, abnormal growth of the
external ear, often occur together, although atresia can
occur without microtia. Surgery to reconstruct the ear
usually takes place when the child is four or five years old
and may require several operations. A facial plastic sur-
geon and an ear surgeon work together, repairing the
microtia first and then the atresia. During surgery, a bony
opening is created over the bones of hearing. The surfaces
of the bony ear canal are then relined with a skin graft
from the thigh or abdomen. Tissue from behind the
eardrum is used to create a new eardrum. In many cases,
the middle ear will also need to be reconstructed. Surgery
is performed in a hospital under general anesthesia.

Along with their beneficial effects, many cancer
treatments produce uncomfortable and sometimes harm-
ful side effects. For example, cancer drugs may cause
nausea or vomiting. They may also destroy red or white
blood cells, resulting in a low blood count. Fortunately,
many of these side effects can be relieved with other
medicines.

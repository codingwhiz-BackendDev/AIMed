Carbon monoxide poisoning is preventable. Particu-
lar care should be paid to situations where fuel is burned
in a confined area. Portable and permanently installed
carbon monoxide detectors that sound a warning similar
to smoke detectors are available for under $50. Specific
actions that will prevent CO poisoning include:
• stop smoking. Smokers have less tolerance to environ-
mental CO
• have heating systems and appliances installed by a
qualified contractor to assure that they are properly
vented and meet local building codes
• inspect and properly maintain heating systems, chim-
neys, and appliances
• do not use a gas oven or stove to heat the home
• do not burn charcoal indoors
• make sure there is good ventilation if using a kerosene
heater indoors
• do not leave cars or trucks running inside the garage
• keep car windows rolled up when stuck in heavy traffic,
especially if inside a tunnel

Adjuvant therapy—A treatment done when there is
no evidence of residual cancer in order to aid the
primary treatment. Adjuvant treatments for endome-
trial cancer are radiation therapy, chemotherapy,
and hormone therapy.
Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia—The over-
growth of the endometrium. This precancerous con-
dition is estimated to progress to cancer in one third
of the cases.
Dilation and curettage (D & C)—A procedure in
which the doctor opens the cervix and uses a spe-
cial instrument to scrape tissue from the inside of
the uterus.
Endometrial biopsy—A procedure in which a sam-
ple of the endometrium is removed and examined
under a microscope.
Endometrium—The mucosal layer lining the inner
cavity of the uterus. The endometrium’s structure
changes with age and with the menstrual cycle.
Estrogen—A female hormone responsible for stimu-
lating the development and maintenance of female
secondary sexual characteristics.
Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT)—A treatment
in which estrogen is used therapeutically during
menopause to alleviate certain symptoms such as
hot flashes. ERT has also been shown to reduce the
risk of osteoporosis and heart disease in women.
Progesterone—A female hormone that acts on the
inner lining of the uterus and prepares it for implan-
tation of the fertilized egg.
Progestins—A female hormone, like progesterone,
that acts on the inner lining of the uterus.
endometrial cancer. The stage of cancer is determined after
surgery. Endometrial cancer is categorized into four stages
(I, II, III, and IV) that are subdivided (A, B, and possibly C)
based on the depth or spread of cancerous tissue. Seventy
percent of all uterine cancers are stage I, 10–15% are stage
II, and the remainder are stages III and IV. The cancer is
also graded (G1, G2, and G3) based upon microscopic
analysis of the aggressiveness of the cancer cells.

The most frequent cause of FUO is still infection,
though the percentage has decreased in recent years.
Tuberculosis remains an important cause, especially
when it occurs outside the lungs. The decrease in infec-
tions as a cause of FUO is due in part to improved culture
techniques. In addition, technological advances have
made it easier to diagnose non-infectious causes. For
example, tumors and autoimmune diseases in particular
are now easier to diagnose. (An autoimmune disease is
one that arises when the body tolerance for its own cell
antigenic cell markers disappears.)
Allergies to medications can also cause prolonged
fever; sometimes patients will have other symptoms sug-
gesting an allergic reaction, such as a rash.

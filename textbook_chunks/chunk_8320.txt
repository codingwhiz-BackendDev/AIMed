Before inserting the diaphragm, the woman should
empty her bladder and wash her hands with soap and
water. The device should be checked for leaks by filling
it with water or holding it up to the light. A spermicidal
jelly is then applied to the inside and outside, and espe-
cially around the rim. While standing with one foot ele-
vated on a chair or step, lying down, or squatting, the
woman folds the diaphragm inward toward the middle
and inserts it into the vagina as far as it will go.

COPD is one of the fastest-growing health prob-
lems. Nearly 16 million people in the United States, 14
million with chronic bronchitis and two million with
emphysema, suffer from COPD. COPD is responsible
for more than 96,000 deaths annually, making it the
fourth leading cause of death. Although COPD is more
common in men than women, the increase in incidence
of smoking among women since World War II has pro-
duced an increase in deaths from COPD in women.
COPD has a large economic impact on the healthcare
system and a destructive impact on the lives of patients
and their families. Quality of life for a person with
COPD decreases as the disease progresses.

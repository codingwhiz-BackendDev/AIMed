Cancerous tumors should be removed upon discov-
ery, and noncancerous tumors should be removed before
they become big enough to interfere with vision or eyelid
function. Eyelid tumors require special consideration
because of their sensitive location. It is important that
treatment not compromise vision, eye movement, or eye-
lid movement. Accordingly, eyelid reconstruction will
sometimes accompany tumor excision.

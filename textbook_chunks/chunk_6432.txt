Owing to an upper respiratory viral infection, the
larynx and trachea may become inflamed or swollen. The
hallmark sign of croup is a harsh, barking cough. This
cough may be preceded by one to three days of symp-
toms that resemble a slight cold. A croupy cough is often
accompanied by a runny nose, hoarseness, and a low
fever. When the child inhales, there may be a raspy or
high-pitched noise, called stridor, owing to the narrowed
airway and accumulated mucus. In the presence of stri-
dor, medical attention is required.
However, the airway rarely narrows so much that
breathing is impeded. Symptoms usually abate complete-
ly within a few days. Medical treatment may be sought if
the child’s symptoms do not respond to home treatment.
Emergency medical treatment is required immediate-
ly if the child has difficulty breathing, swallowing, or talk-
ing; develops a high fever (103°F/39.4°C or more); seems
unalert or confused; or has pale or blue-tinged skin.

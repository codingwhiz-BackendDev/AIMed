The two most common congenital bladder abnor-
malities are exstrophy and congenital diverticula. An
exstrophic bladder is one that is open to the outside and
turned inside-out, so that its inside is visible at birth, pro-
truding from the lower abdomen. A diverticulum is an
extension of a hollow organ, usually shaped like a pouch
with a narrow opening.

dislocation (shoulder)
Dislocations and subluxations refer to the displacement of bones that form a joint. Such conditions most often result from
trauma causing adjoining bones to no longer touch each other. A partial or incomplete dislocation is called a subluxation.
The illustrations above indicate dislocation of the jaw bone, shoulder blade, hip bone, and the thumb. (Illustration by Electronic

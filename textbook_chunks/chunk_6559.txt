Dehydration and malnutrition are the most com-
mon effects of infection. In about 20% of AIDS patients,
bile duct infection also occurs and causes symptoms sim-
ilar to gallbladder attacks. Eighty percent or more of
those with infection of the bile ducts die from the dis-
ease. The lungs and pancreas are also sometimes
involved. Cryptosporidia are just one cause of the diar-
rhea wasting syndrome in AIDS, which results in severe
weight loss and malnutrition.

Chemotherapy commonly causes bone marrow
suppression. Additionally, a cell called platelets—
important for normal blood clotting—may be signifi-
cantly lowered, causing patients to bleed. This may be
problematic enough to limit the treatment course. Bone
marrow suppression can increase susceptibility to
infection and also cause infertility. Patients commonly
have bouts of nausea and vomiting shortly after a
treatment session. Rapidly multiplying normal cells are
also affected such as skin cells (causing blistering and
ulceration) and hair cells (causing loss of hair, a condi-
tion called alopecia).

Individuals under stress often experience fast, shal-
low breathing. This type of breathing, known as chest
breathing, can lead to shortness of breath, increased
muscle tension, inadequate oxygenation of blood, and
fatigue. Breathing exercises can both improve respiratory
function and relieve stress and fatigue.
Deep breathing exercises are best performed while
laying flat on the back on a hard surface, usually the floor.
The knees are bent, and the body (particularly the mouth,
nose, and face) is relaxed. One hand should be placed on
the chest and one on the abdomen to monitor breathing
technique. With proper breathing techniques, the abdomen
will rise further than the chest. The individual takes a series
of long, deep breaths through the nose, attempting to raise
the abdomen instead of the chest. Air is exhaled through
the relaxed mouth. Deep breathing can be continued for up
to 20 minutes. After the exercise is complete, the individual
checks again for body tension and relaxation. Once deep
breathing techniques have been mastered, an individual can
use deep breathing at any time or place as a quick method
of relieving tension and preventing fatigue.

Allergen—A foreign substance that provokes an
immune reaction in some sensitive people but not
in most others.
Anaphylaxis—An exaggerated, life-threatening
hypersensitivity reaction to a previously encoun-
tered antigen.
Antibody—An immune system protein made to
fight infection.
Antigen—A foreign substance detected that pro-
vokes an immune reaction.
Absence of any reaction to injected areas indi-
cates lack of T cell responsiveness, a condition called
anergy. T cell anergy is seen in immune deficiency
diseases including AIDS, some cases of infectious
diseases, malignancies, immunosuppressive therapy
(including corticosteroid treatment), some autoim-
mune diseases, malnutrition, major surgery, and some
viral immunizations.

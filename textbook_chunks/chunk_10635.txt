Normal precautions should be taken with any diag-
nostic procedure. Since the population in which this pro-
cedure is normally done is elderly, the imaging staff
should be extra cautious about stressing the patient. The

places an added burden on already stressed hearts and
nervous systems. Physicians, nurses, and technicians
may need to be prepared for stress reactions that could
include the heart, asthma, or anxious behaviors.

Following the procedure, blood thinners (anticoagu-
lants) will be given through a needle in a vein for about
24 hours. The patient should remain flat and still for
awhile to allow the femoral artery to heal from the inser-
tion of the catheter. Medication to control blood clotting
should be taken after the patient is discharged from the
hospital. A special diet may also be recommended that is
low in vitamin K and cholesterol. With time, the patient
should begin light exercise, like walking. It is important
that no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests are
given for six months because the magnetic field may
move the stent.

(IV) drug users. People in the past have contracted
hepatitis C through blood transfusions.
Liver injury, reactions to prescription medications,
exposure to toxic substances, and repeated episodes of
heart failure with liver congestion can cause cirrhosis.
The disorder can also be a result of diseases that run in
families (inherited diseases) like:
• a lack of a specific liver enzyme (alpha1-antitrypsin
deficiency)
• the absence of a milk-digesting enzyme (galactosemia)
• an inability to convert sugars to energy (glycogen stor-
age disease)
• an absorption deficit in which excess iron is deposited in
the liver, pancreas, heart, and other organs (hemochro-
matosis)
• a disorder characterized by accumulations of copper in
the liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas (Wilson’s disease)
Poor nutrition increases a person’s risk of develop-
ing cirrhosis. In about 10 out of every 100 patients, the
cause of cirrhosis cannot be determined. Many people
who have cirrhosis do not have any symptoms (often
called compensated cirrhosis). Their disease is detected
during a routine physical or when tests for an unrelated
medical problem are performed. This type of cirrhosis
can also be detected when complications occur (decom-
pensated cirrhosis).

Definition
Congenital amputation is the absence of a fetal
limb or fetal part at birth. This condition may be the
result of the constriction of fibrous bands within the
membrane that surrounds the developing fetus (amniotic
band syndrome) or the exposure to substances known to
cause birth defects (teratogenic agents). Other factors,
including genetics, may also play a role.

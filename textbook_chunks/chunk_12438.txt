Fanconi’s syndrome is best treated by attacking the
underlying cause whenever possible. For example, when
cystinosis is treated with the drug cysteamine to lower
cystine levels in the body or Wilson disease is treated
with penicillamine to lower the levels of copper, accom-
panying symptoms of Fanconi’s syndrome will subside.
If the patient has acquired the disease from a heavy metal
or another toxic agent, all contact with the toxic agent
should stop; the condition will then likely disappear.
Nevertheless, additional treatment will be necessary
either when it’s not possible to treat the underlying cause
or while waiting for the kidneys to resume normal func-
tion. This is done by restricting sodium chloride (table
salt), giving antacids to counteract the excessive acidity
of the blood, and supplying potassium supplements.
Kidney transplant is the treatment of last resort, used
for patients whose kidneys have failed.

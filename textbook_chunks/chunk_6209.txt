Before the operation, the patient will have undergone
diagnostic procedures such as computed tomography
scans (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
to determine the underlying problem that required the
craniotomy and to get a better look at the brainâ€™s structure.
Cerebral angiography may be used to study the blood
supply to the tumor, aneurysm, or other brain lesion.

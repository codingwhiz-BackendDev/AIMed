There is no such thing as a normal or typical female
breast. Breasts come in all shapes and sizes, with varying
textures from smooth to extremely lumpy. The tissues of
the female breast change in response to hormone levels,
normal aging, nursing (lactation), weight fluctuations,
and injury. To further complicate matters, the breast has
several types of tissue; each of these tissue types may
respond differently to changes in body chemistry.
Fibrocystic breast condition may be called fibrocystic
disease, although it is clearly not a single, specific disease
process. Variations or changes in the way the breast feels or
looks on x ray may cause the condition to be called “fibro-
cystic change.” Other names have been used to refer to this
imprecise and ill-defined term: mammary dysplasia,
mastopathy, chronic cystic mastitis, indurative mastopathy,
mastalgia, lumpy breasts, or physiologic nodularity.
Estimates vary, but 40–90% of all women have some
evidence of “fibrocystic” condition, change, or disease. It
is most common among women between the ages 30 and
50, but may be seen at other ages.

For those individuals who are diagnosed early
enough and take colchicine consistently, the prognosis is
excellent. Most will have very few, if any, attacks of
fever and polyserositis, and will likely not develop seri-
ous complications of amyloidosis. The problem of misdi-
agnosing FMF continues, but education attempts directed
at both the public and medical care providers should
improve the situation. Future research should provide a
better understanding of the inflammation process, focus-
ing on how neutrophils are genetically regulated. That
information could then be used to develop treatments for
FMF with fewer side effects, and might also assist in
developing therapies for other diseases in which abnor-
mal inflammation and immune response are a problem.

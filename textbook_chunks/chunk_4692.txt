If any abnormal areas are seen, the doctor will take a
biopsy of the tissue, a common procedure that takes
about 15 minutes. Several samples might be taken,
depending on the size of the abnormal area. A biopsy
may cause temporary discomfort and cramping, which
usually go away within a few minutes. If the abnormal
area appears to extend inside the cervical canal, a scrap-
ing of the canal may be done. The biopsy results are usu-
ally available within a week.
If the tissue sample indicates abnormal growth (dys-
plasia) or precancer, and if the entire abnormal area can
be seen, the doctor can destroy the tissue using one of
several procedures, including ones that use high heat
(diathermy), extreme cold (cryosurgery), or lasers.
Another procedure, called a loop electrosurgical excision
(LEEP), uses low-voltage high-frequency radio waves to
excise tissue. If any of the abnormal tissue is within the
cervical canal, a cone biopsy (removal of a conical sec-
tion of the cervix for inspection) will be needed.

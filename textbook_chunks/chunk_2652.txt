white blood cell count means that the immune system
cannot function properly. Low levels of platelets can
cause a patient to bleed easily from a cut or other wound.
A low red blood cell count can lead to anemia (deficien-
cy of red blood cells) and fatigue.
When a chemotherapy treatment takes a long time, the
patient may prepare for it by wearing comfortable clothes.
Bringing a book to read or a tape to listen to may help pass
the time and ease the stress of receiving chemotherapy.
Some patients bring a friend or family member to provide
company and support during treatment.
Sometimes, patients taking chemotherapy drugs
known to cause nausea are given medications called anti-
emetics before chemotherapy is administered. Anti-emet-
ic drugs help to lessen feelings of nausea. Two anti-nau-
sea medications that may be used are Kytril and Zofran.
Other ways to prepare for chemotherapy and help
lessen nausea are:
• regularly eat nutritious foods and drink lots of fluids
• eat and drink normally until about two hours before
chemotherapy
• eat high carbohydrate, low-fat foods and avoid spicy
foods

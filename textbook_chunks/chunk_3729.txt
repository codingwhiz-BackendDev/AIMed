The genetic defect that causes CGD reduces the
amount of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide that white
blood cells can make. These chemicals are important for
killing bacteria and fungi. Without them the white blood
cells ingest the microorganisms, but canâ€™t kill them. In
some cases, the microbes then replicate inside the white
blood cell eventually causing its death.

The rate of progression of FA is highly variable. Most
patients lose the ability to walk within 15 years of symp-
tom onset, and 95% require a wheelchair for mobility by
age 45. Reduction in lifespan from FA complications is
also quite variable. Average age at death is in the mid-thir-
ties, but may be as late as the mid-sixties. As of mid-1998,
the particular length of the triple repeat has not been corre-
lated strongly enough with disease progression to allow
prediction of the course of the disease on this basis.

Certain cancers like breast, colon, ovarian and uter-
ine cancer recur generation after generation in some fami-
lies. A few cancers, such as the eye cancer “retinoblas-
toma,” a type of colon cancer, and a type of breast cancer
known as “early-onset breast cancer,” have been shown to
be linked to certain genes that can be tracked within a
family. It is therefore possible that inheriting particular
genes makes a person susceptible to certain cancers.

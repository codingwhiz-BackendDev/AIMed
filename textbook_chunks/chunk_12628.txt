lapse or certain other problems exist. Rectal prolapse
means that the patient’s rectum has been weakened and
drops down through the anus. Next, the doctor uses a pin
or probe to stroke the perianal skin. Normally this touch-
ing causes the anal sphincter to contract and the anus to
pucker; if it does not, nerve damage may be present. The
final phase of the examination requires the doctor to
examine internal structures by carefully inserting a
gloved and lubricated finger into the anal canal. This
allows the doctor to judge the strength of the anal sphinc-
ter and a key muscle (the puborectalis muscle) in main-
taining continence; to look for abnormalities such as
scars and rectal masses; and to learn many other things
about the patient’s medical situation. At this point the
doctor performs the anal wink test again and asks the
patient to squeeze and bear down.

Initially, alternative practitioners will suggest that
the patient drink an adequate amount of water each day
(six to eight glasses), exercise on a regular basis, and eat
a diet high in soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibers
include pectin, flax, and gums; insoluble fibers include
psyllium and brans from grains like wheat and oats.
Fresh fruits and vegetables contain both soluble and
insoluble fibers. Castor oil, applied topically to the
abdomen and covered by a heat source (a heating pad or
hot water bottle), can help relieve constipation when
used nightly for 20â€“30 minutes.

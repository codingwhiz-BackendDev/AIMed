Certain foods and medicines can influence the test
results. Some fruits contain chemicals that prevent the
guaiac, the chemical in which the test paper is soaked,
from reacting with the blood. Aspirin and some NSAIDs
irritate the stomach, resulting in bleeding and should be
avoided prior to the examination, along with red meat
and many vegetables and fruits containing vitamin C. All
of these factors could result in a false-positive test.

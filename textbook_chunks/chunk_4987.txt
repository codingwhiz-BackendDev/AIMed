tracted the disease when condoms were used with every
instance of sexual intercourse. A similar 1993 study
showed that out of 171 couples with one HIV-positive
partner, all but two individuals were protected against
HIV transmission with condom use. In addition to HIV,
condoms provide effective transmission against gonor-
rhea, chlamydia, syphilis, chancroid, and trichomonia-
sis. A measure of protection is also provided against
hepatitis B virus (HBV), human papillomavirus (HPV),
and herpes simplex virus (HSV).
Before purchasing a condom, check the expiration
date. Prior to use, examine the condom for holes. If a
lubricant is going to be used, it should be water solu-
ble because petroleum jellies, such as Vaseline, and
other oil based lubricants can weaken latex. It is also
important to note that condoms made from animal tis-
sue or plastic are not recommended as a protection
against STDs.

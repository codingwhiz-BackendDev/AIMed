Every cell in the human body needs energy in order
to function. The bodyâ€™s primary energy source is glu-
cose, a simple sugar resulting from the digestion of
foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches).
Glucose from the digested food circulates in the blood
as a ready energy source for any cells that need it.
Insulin is a hormone or chemical produced by cells in
the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach.
Insulin bonds to a receptor site on the outside of cell and
acts like a key to open a doorway into the cell through
which glucose can enter. Some of the glucose can be
converted to concentrated energy sources like glycogen
or fatty acids and saved for later use. When there is not
enough insulin produced or when the doorway no longer
recognizes the insulin key, glucose stays in the blood
rather entering the cells.
The body will attempt to dilute the high level of
glucose in the blood, a condition called hyperglycemia,
by drawing water out of the cells and into the blood-
stream in an effort to dilute the sugar and excrete it in
the urine. It is not unusual for people with undiagnosed
diabetes to be constantly thirsty, drink large quantities of
water, and urinate frequently as their bodies try to get rid
of the extra glucose. This creates high levels of glucose
in the urine.
At the same time that the body is trying to get rid
of glucose from the blood, the cells are starving for glu-
cose and sending signals to the body to eat more food,
thus making patients extremely hungry. To provide
energy for the starving cells, the body also tries to con-
vert fats and proteins to glucose. The breakdown of fats
and proteins for energy causes acid compounds called
ketones to form in the blood. Ketones will also be
excreted in the urine. As ketones build up in the blood,
a condition called ketoacidosis can occur. This condi-
tion can be life threatening if left untreated, leading to
coma and death.

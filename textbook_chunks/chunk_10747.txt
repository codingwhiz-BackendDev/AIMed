water enemas can cause cardiovascular overload and
electrolyte imbalance. Similarly, repeated saline enemas
can cause increased absorption of fluid and electrolytes
into the bloodstream, resulting in overload. Individuals
receiving frequent enemas should be observed for over-
load symptoms that include dizziness, sweating, or
vomiting.
Soap suds and saline used for cleansing enemas can
cause irritation of the lining of the bowel, with repeated
use or a solution that is too strong. Only white soap
should be used; the bar should not have been previously
used, to prevent infusing undesirable organisms into the
individual receiving the enema. Common household
detergents are considered too strong for the rectum and
bowel. The commercially prepared castile soap is pre-
ferred, and should be used in concentration no greater
than 5 cc soap to 1,000 cc of water.

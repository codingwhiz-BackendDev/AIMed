EDTA chelation is a highly controversial therapy.
The treatment is approved by the United States Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for lead poisoning and seri-
ously high calcium levels. However, for the treatment of
atherosclerotic heart disease, EDTA chelation therapy is
not endorsed by the American Heart Association (AHA),
the FDA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), or the
American College of Cardiology. The AHA reports that
there are no adequate, controlled, published scientific
studies using currently approved scientific methods to
support this therapy for the treatment of coronary artery
disease. However, a pooled analysis from the results of
over 70 studies showed positive results in all but one.

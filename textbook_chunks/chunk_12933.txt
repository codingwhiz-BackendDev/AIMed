Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to the pres-
ence of a documented fever for a specified time, for
which a cause has not been found after a basic medical
evaluation. The classic criteria developed in 1961 includ-
ed: temperature greater than 101°F (38.3°C), for at least
three weeks, and inability to find a cause after one week
of study. Within the past decade, a revision has been pro-
posed that categorizes FUO into classic, hospital
acquired FUO, FUO associated with low white blood
counts, and HIV associated FUO (AIDS related).

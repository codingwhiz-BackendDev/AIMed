Enterostomies are usually performed only as emer-
gency treatments for traumatic injuries in the abdomen or
as final measures for serious disorders of the intestines.
Most patients do not refuse to have the operation per-
formed when the need for it is explained to them. A small
minority, however, refuse enterostomies because of
strong psychological reactions to personal disfigurement
and the need to relearn bowel habits.

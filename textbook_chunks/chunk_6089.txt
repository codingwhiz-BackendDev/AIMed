Though the causes of costochondritis are not well
known, avoidance of activities that may strain (e.g., the
repetitive misuse of muscles) or cause trauma to the rib
cage is recommended to prevent the occurrence of costo-
chondritis. Modification of improper posture or
ergonomics of the home or work place may also deter the
development of this condition.

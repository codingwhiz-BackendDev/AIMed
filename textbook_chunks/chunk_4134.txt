Factor XI deficiency, or hemophilia C, occurs more
frequently among certain ethnic groups, with an incidence
of about one in 10,000 among Ashkenazi Jews. Nearly
50% of patients with this disorder experience no symp-
toms, but others may notice blood in their urine, nose-
bleeds, or bruising. Although joint bleeding seldom occurs,
some factor XI patients will experience bleeding long after
an injury occurs. Some women will experience prolonged
bleeding after childbirth. Patients with factor VII deficien-
cy vary greatly in their bleeding severity. Women may
experience heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding from the
gums or nose, bleeding deep within the skin, and episodes
of bleeding into the stomach, intestine, and urinary tract.
Factor VII patients may also suffer bleeding into joints.

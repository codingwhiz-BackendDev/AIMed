Ultrasound imaging equipment allows eye special-
ists (ophthalmologists) to “see” the eye in great detail
without the pain and risk of exploratory surgery, or the
limitations and uncertainty inherent to traditional visu-
al examination. Ultrasound is used to detect and diag-
nose many eye diseases and injuries, to measure the
eye prior to corrective surgery, and directly as a treat-
ment tool.

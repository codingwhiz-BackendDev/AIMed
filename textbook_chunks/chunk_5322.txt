Ebstein’s anomaly is a rare congenital syndrome that
causes malformed tricuspid valve leaflets, which allow
blood to leak between the right ventricle and the right
atrium. It also may cause a hole in the wall between the
left and right atrium. Treatment often involves repairing
the tricuspid valve. Ebstein’s anomaly may be associated
with maternal use of the psychiatric drug lithium during
pregnancy.
Brugada syndrome is another rare congenital heart
defect that appears in adulthood and may cause sudden
death if untreated. Symptoms, which include rapid,
uneven heart beat, often appear at night. Scientists believe
that Brugada syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene
SCN5A, which involves cardiac sodium channels.
Infants born with DiGeorge sequence can have heart
defects such as a malformed aortic arch and tetralogy of
Fallot. Researchers believe DiGeorge sequence is most
often caused by mutations in genes in the region 22q11.
Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder
that causes tears in the aorta. Since the disease also causes
excessive bone growth, most Marfan syndrome patients
are over six feet tall. In athletes, and others, it can lead to
sudden death. Researchers believe the defect responsible
for Marfan’s syndrome is found in gene FBN1, on chro-
mosome 15.
About 32,000 infants are born every year with con-
genital heart disease, which is the most common birth
defect. About half of these cases require medical treat-
ment. More than one million people with heart defects
are currently living in the United States.

The main purpose of chemotherapy is to kill cancer
cells. It is usually used to treat patients with cancer that
has spread from the place in the body where it started
(metastasized). Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells any-
where in the body. It even kills cells that have broken off
from the main tumor and traveled through the blood or
lymph systems to other parts of the body.
Chemotherapy can cure some types of cancer. In
some cases, it is used to slow the growth of cancer cells
or to keep the cancer from spreading to other parts of the
body. When a cancer has been removed by surgery,
chemotherapy may be used to keep the cancer from com-
ing back (adjuvant therapy). Chemotherapy also can ease
the symptoms of cancer, helping some patients to have a
better quality of life.

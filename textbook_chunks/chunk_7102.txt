Categorized as an endoscopic procedure, cystoscopy
is used by urologists to examine the entire bladder lining
and take biopsies of any areas that look questionable. This
test is not used on a routine basis, but may benefit the urol-
ogist who is needing further information about a patient
who displays the following symptoms or diagnosis:
• blood in the urine (also known as hematuria)
• incontinence or the inabililty to control urination
• a urinary tract infection
• a urinary tract which display signs of congenital abnor-
malities
• tumors located in the bladder
• the presence of bladder or kidney stones
• a stiffness or strained feeling of the urethra or ureters
• symptoms of an enlarged prostate
Blood and urine studies, in addition to x rays of the
kidneys, ureters, and bladder, may all occur before a cys-
toscopy. At the time of surgery, a retrograde pyelogram
may also be performed. Additional blood studies may be
needed immediately following surgery.

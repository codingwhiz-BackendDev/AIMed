Face lift surgery can be performed on an outpatient
basis with local anesthetics. Patients typically also
receive “twilight anesthesia,” an intravenous sedative that
helps to lower their awareness of the procedure being
performed.
There are a number of variations of face lift surgery.
Which one is used will depend on the patient’s facial
structure, how much correction is needed, and the prefer-
ences of the surgeon performing the procedure. In a typi-
cal face lift surgery, the surgeon begins by making an inci-
sion within the hairline just above the ear. The incision
continues down along the front edge of the ear, around the
earlobe, and then up and behind the ear extending back
into the hairline. The location of this incision is designed
to hide any sign of the procedure later. The same proce-
dure is repeated on the other side of the face. Using vari-
ous instruments, the surgeon will then work to separate the
skin of the face from its underlying tissue, moving down
to the cheek and into the neck area and below the chin. Fat
deposits over the cheeks and in the neck may be removed
surgically or with liposuction at this time. The surgeon
will then work to free up and tighten certain bands of mus-
cle and tissue that extend up from the shoulder, below the
chin, and up and behind the neck. If these muscles and tis-
sue are not tightened, the looseness and sagging appear-
ance of the skin will return. The surgeon then trims excess
skin from the edges of the original incision, pulls the skin
back, and staples or sutures it into place.

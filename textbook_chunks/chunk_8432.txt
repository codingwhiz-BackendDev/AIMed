The esophagus is a muscular tube that actively trans-
ports food from the throat to the stomach by rhythmic
contractions known as peristalsis. The actual mechanism
and anatomy are quite complex, involving three distinct
segments and allowing a person to swallow even when
upside-down. Diffuse esophageal spasm describes a con-
dition where the entire esophagus is spasticâ€”along its
entire length, the muscular activity is increased and
uncoordinated. The name corkscrew esophagus describes
perfectly the appearance of this disorder on x rays.
X rays may reveal a slightly different appearance
and result in the designation rosary bead esophagus, but
the cause is still diffuse spasm, and the two entities
behave in the same way.

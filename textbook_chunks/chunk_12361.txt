FAP is caused by a portion of a gene that mutates or
changes. The original cause of the mutation is unknown.
Its exact role in FAP is not completely clear. Researchers
theorize that the normal gene directs the manufacture of
a protein which helps control cell growth. The mutated
gene section in FAP generates an abnormal protein
which does not perform its normal function. Cells grow
out of control, causing the development of multiple,
sometimes hundreds, of polyps. One or more of these
eventually becomes cancerous.
Many individuals develop polyps without display-
ing any symptoms. Others experience such gastrointesti-
nal problems as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal
cramps, blood in the stool, or weight loss. FAP patients
may also develop nonmalignant tumors (desmoid
tumors), and/or some bone and dental abnormalities. In
addition, they may exhibit a “spot” on the retina of the
eye (congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment
epithelium, or CHRPE).
Relatives of individuals with diagnosed FAP are at
high risk of having the disease themselves. There are no
other known risk factors for this condition.

First, a “topical” (local) medication to numb the gag
reflex is given either by spray or is gargled. Patients are
usually sedated for the procedure (though not always) by
injection of medications into a vein. The endoscopist
then has the patient swallow the scope, which is passed
through the upper gastrointestinal tract. The lens or cam-
era at the end of the instrument allows the endoscopist to
examine each portion of the upper gastrointestinal tract;
photos can be taken for reference. Air is pumped in
through the instrument to allow proper observation.
Biopsies and other procedures can be performed without
any significant discomfort.

More than 50 chemotherapy drugs are currently
available to treat cancer and many more are being tested
for their ability to destroy cancer cells. Most chemothera-
py drugs interfere with the ability of cells to grow or mul-
tiply. Although these drugs affect all cells in the body,
many useful treatments are most effective against rapidly
growing cells. Cancer cells grow more quickly than most
other body cells. Other cells that grow fast are cells of the
bone marrow that produce blood cells, cells in the stom-
ach and intestines, and cells of the hair follicles. There-
fore, the most common side effects of chemotherapy are
linked to their effects on other fast growing cells.

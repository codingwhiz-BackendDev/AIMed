CMT1A. The most common type of CMT is called
CMT1A. It is caused by a mutation in a gene called
peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) located on chro-
mosome 17. The job of this gene is to make a protein
(PMP22) that makes up part of the myelin. In most people
who have CMT, the mutation that causes the condition is
a duplication (doubling) of the PMP22 gene. Instead of
having two copies of the PMP22 gene (one on each chro-
mosome) there are three copies. It is not known how this
extra copy of the PMP22 gene causes the observed symp-
toms. A small percentage of people with CMT1A do not
have a duplication of the PMP22 gene, but rather have a
point mutation in the gene. A point mutation is like a typo
in the gene that causes it to work incorrectly.
HEREDITARY NEUROPATHY WITH LIABILITY TO PRES-
SURE PALSIES (HNPP). HNPP is a condition that is also
caused by a mutation in the PMP22 gene. The mutation
is a deletion. Therefore, there is only one copy of the
PMP22 gene instead of two. People who have HNPP
may have some of the signs of CMT. However, they also
have episodes where they develop weakness and prob-
lems with sensation after compression of certain pressure
points such as the elbows or knee. Often these symptoms
will resolve after a few days or weeks, but sometimes
they are permanent.
CMT1B. Another type of CMT, called CMT1B, is
caused by a mutation in a gene called myelin protein zero
(MPZ) located on chromosome 1. The job of this gene is
to make the layers of myelin stick together as they are
wrapped around the axon. The mutations in this gene are
point mutations because they involve a change (either
deletion, substitution, or insertion) at one specific com-
ponent of a gene.

Symptoms of diabetes can develop suddenly (over
days or weeks) in previously healthy children or adoles-
cents, or can develop gradually (over several years) in
overweight adults over the age of 40. The classic symp-
toms include feeling tired and sick, frequent urination,
excessive thirst, excessive hunger, and weight loss.
Ketoacidosis, a condition due to starvation or
uncontrolled diabetes, is common in Type I diabetes.
Ketones are acid compounds that form in the blood when
the body breaks down fats and proteins. Symptoms
include abdominal pain, vomiting, rapid breathing,
extreme lethargy and drowsiness. Patients with ketoaci-
dosis will also have a sweet breath odor. Left untreated,
this condition can lead to coma and death.
With Type II diabetes, the condition may not become
evident until the patient presents for medical treatment for
some other condition. A patient may have heart disease,
chronic infections of the gums and urinary tract, blurred
vision, numbness in the feet and legs, or slow-healing
wounds. Women may experience genital itching.

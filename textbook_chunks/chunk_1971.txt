Definition
Cerebral palsy (CP) is the term used for a group of
nonprogressive disorders of movement and posture
caused by abnormal development of, or damage to,
motor control centers of the brain. CP is caused by events
before, during, or after birth. The abnormalities of mus-
cle control that define CP are often accompanied by
other neurological and physical abnormalities.

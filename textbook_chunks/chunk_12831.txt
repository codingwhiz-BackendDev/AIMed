FAS is a clinical diagnosis, which means that there
is no blood, x ray or psychological test that can be per-
formed to confirm the suspected diagnosis. The diagno-
sis is made based on the history of maternal alcohol use,
and detailed physical examination for the characteristic
major and minor birth defects and characteristic facial
features. It is often helpful to examine siblings and par-
ents of an individual suspected of having FAS, either in
person or by photographs, to determine whether findings
on the examination might be familial, of if other siblings
may also be affected. Sometimes, genetic tests are per-
formed to rule out other conditions that may present with
developmental delay or birth defects. Individuals with
developmental delay, birth defects or other unusual fea-
tures are often referred to a clinical geneticist, develop-
mental pediatrician, or neurologist for evaluation and
diagnosis of FAS. Psychoeducational testing to deter-
mine IQ and/or the presence of learning disabilities may
also be part of the evaluation process.

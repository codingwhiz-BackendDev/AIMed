Joint ligaments have poor blood supply and, there-
fore, heal slowly. This healing process continues long
after the symptoms of the dislocation injury have
diminished. Once a joint has been either subluxated or
completely dislocated, the connective tissue binding or
holding it in correct alignment is stretched to such an
extent that the joint becomes extremely vulnerable to
repeated dislocations. However, this chance of recur-
rent dislocation and subluxation will decrease if a
proper rehabilitation program is implemented to
strengthen surrounding muscles of the joint. Most joint
dislocations are curable with prompt treatment. After
the dislocation has been corrected, the joint may
require immobilization with a cast or sling for two to
eight weeks.

Coronary artery disease is usually caused by athero-
sclerosis. Cholesterol and other fatty substances accumu-
late on the inner wall of the arteries. They attract fibrous
tissue, blood components, and calcium and harden into
artery-clogging plaques. Atherosclerotic plaques often
form blood clots that can also block the coronary arteries
(coronary thrombosis). Congenital defects and muscle
spasms can also block blood flow. Recent research indi-
cates that infection from organisms such as chlamydia
bacteria may be responsible for some cases of coronary
artery disease.
A number of major contributing factors increase the
risk of developing coronary artery disease. Some of these
can be changed and some cannot. People with more risk
factors are more likely to develop coronary artery disease.

Laboratory tests
After taking the womanâ€™s history, the gynecologist
or family practitioner does a pelvic examination and Pap
smear. To rule out specific causes of abnormal bleeding,
the doctor may also do a pregnancy test and blood tests
to check the level of thyroid hormone. Based on the ini-
tial test results, the doctor may want to do tests to deter-
mine the level of other hormones that play a role in
reproduction. A test of blood clotting time and an adrenal
function test are also commonly done.

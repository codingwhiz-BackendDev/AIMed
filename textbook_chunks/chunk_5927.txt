Everyone experiences stress, the mental and physi-
cal reaction to lifeâ€™s irritations and challenges. Stress can
sometimes be avoided and when it is inevitable, it can be
controlled. Techniques for controlling stress include: tak-
ing life more slowly, spending more time with family and
friends, thinking positively, getting enough sleep, exer-
cising, and practicing relaxation techniques.

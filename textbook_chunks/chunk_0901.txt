Curative chemotherapy usually requires multiple
administrations of the chemical agent. Chemotherapy or
systemic therapy is administered in the blood and circu-
lates through the entire body. The choice of chemothera-
peutic agents depends on the specific type of cancer.
Chemotherapy is more commonly used for metastatic
(malignant cancer which has spread to other areas
beyond the primary site of cancer growth) disease, since
very few cancers are cured by systemic therapy.

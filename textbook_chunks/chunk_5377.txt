Conjunctivitis can, in many cases, be prevented, or
at least the course of the disease can be shortened by fol-
lowing some simple practices.
• Frequently wash hands using antiseptic soap, and use
single-use towels during the disease to prevent spread-
ing the infection.
• Avoid chemical irritants and known allergens.
• If in an area where welding occurs, use the proper pro-
tective eye wear and screens to prevent damaging the
eyes.
• Use a clean tissue to remove discharge from eyes, and
wash hands to prevent the spread of infection.

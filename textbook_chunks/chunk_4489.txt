Of all of the major cancers, only colorectal cancer
can be prevented by screening. In all other cancers (breast
and prostate, for example), screening tests look for small,
malignant lesions. Screening for colorectal cancers, how-
ever, is the search for pre-malignant, benign polyps. This
screening can be close to 100% effective in preventing
cancer development, not just in detecting small cancers.
Screening involves physical exam, simple laboratory
tests, and the visualization of the lining of the colon. The
ways to visualize the colon epithelium are with x rays (indi-
rect visualization), and endoscopy (direct visualization).
The physical examination involves the perfor-
mance of a digital rectal exam (DRE). The DRE includes
manual examination of the rectum, anus, and the
prostate. During this examination, the physician exam-
ines the anus and the surrounding skin for hemorrhoids,
abscesses, and other irregularities. After lubricating the
gloved finger and anus, the examiner gently slides the
finger into the anus and follows the contours of the rec-
tum. The examiner notes the tone of the anus and feels
the walls and the edges for texture, tenderness and mass-
es as far as the examining finger can reach. At the time of
this exam, the physician checks the stool on the examin-
ing glove with a chemical to see if any occult (invisible),
blood is present. At home, after having a bowel move-
ment, the patient is asked to swipe a sample of stool
obtained with a small stick on a card. After 3 such speci-
mens are on the card, the card is then easily chemically
tested for occult blood also. (The stool analysis men-
tioned here is known as a fecal occult blood test, or
FOBT, and, while it can be helpful, it is not 100% accu-
rateâ€”only about 50% of cancers are FOBT-positive.)
These exams are accomplished as an easy part of a rou-
tine yearly physical exam.

• Fecal bacteria are more likely to be able to infect the
cornea.
• A bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which
can contaminate eyedrops, is particularly able to cause
corneal infection.
• A group of incomplete bacteria known as Chlamydia
can be transmitted to the eye directly by flies or dirty
hands. One form of chlamydial infection is the leading
cause of blindness in developing countries and is known
as Egyptian ophthalmia or trachoma. Another type of
Chlamydia causes a sexually transmitted disease.
• Other sexually transmitted diseases—for example,
syphilis—can affect the cornea.
The most common viruses to damage the cornea are
adenoviruses and herpes viruses. Viral and fungal infec-
tions are often caused by improper use of topical corti-
costeroids. If topical corticosteroids are used in a patient
with herpes simplex keratitis, the ulcer can get much
worse and blindness could result.

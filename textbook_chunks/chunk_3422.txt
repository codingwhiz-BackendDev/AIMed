A number of clinical studies have indicated that garlic
can offer modest reductions in cholesterol. A 1997 study by
nutrition researchers at Pennsylvania State University
found men who took garlic capsules for five months
reduced their total cholesterol by 7% and LDL by 12%.
Another study showed that seven cloves of fresh garlic a day
significantly reduced LDL, as did a daily dose of four garlic
extract pills. Other studies in 1997 and 1998 back up these
results. However, two more recent studies have questioned
the effectiveness of garlic in lowering “bad cholesterol.”

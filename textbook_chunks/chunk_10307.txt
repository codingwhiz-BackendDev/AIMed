Emphysema is a serious and chronic disease that
cannot be reversed. If detected early, the effects and
progression can be slowed, particularly if the patient
stops smoking immediately. Complications of emphy-
sema include higher risks for pneumonia and acute
bronchitis. Overall, the prognosis for patients with
emphysema is poor, with a survival rate for all those
with COPD of four years, and even less for emphyse-
ma. However, individual cases vary and many patients
can live much longer with supplemental oxygen and
other treatment measures.

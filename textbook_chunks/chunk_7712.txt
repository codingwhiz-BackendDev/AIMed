Dental trauma may be inflicted in a number of ways:
contact sports, motor vehicle accidents, fights, falls, eat-
ing hard foods, drinking hot liquids, and other such
mishaps. As oral tissues are highly sensitive, injuries to
the mouth are typically very painful. Dental trauma
should receive prompt treatment from a dentist.

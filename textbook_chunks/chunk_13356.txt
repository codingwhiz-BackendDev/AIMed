Originally, Bach collected the dew from chosen
flowers by hand to provide his patients with the required
remedy. This became impractical when his treatment
became so popular that production could not keep up
with demand. He then set about finding a way to manu-
facture the remedies, and found that floating the freshly
picked petals on the surface of spring water in a glass
bowl and leaving them in strong sunlight for three hours
produced the desired effect. Therapists explain that the
water is “potentized” by the essence of the flowers. The
potentized water can then be bottled and sold. For more
woody specimens, the procedure is to boil them in a ster-
ilized pan of water for 30 minutes. These two methods
produce “mother tinctures” and the same two methods
devised by Bach are still used today. Flower essences do
not contain any artificial chemical substances, except for
alcohol preservative.
Bach remedies cost around $10 each, and there is no
set time limit for treatment. It may take days, weeks, or in
some cases months. Flower essences cost around $6 each,
and there is also no set time for the length of treatment, or
the amount of essences that may be taken. These treat-
ments are not generally covered by medical insurance.

Generally, fifth disease is mild, and patients tend to
improve without any complications. In cases where the
patient is either immunocompromised or immunosup-
pressed, a life-threatening aplastic crisis can occur. With
prompt treatment, however, the prognosis is good. Moth-
ers who develop the infection while pregnant can pass
the infection on to their fetus, and as such, stand an
increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. There are
tests and treatments, however, that can be performed on
the fetus while still in the uterus that can reduce the risk
of anemia or other complications.

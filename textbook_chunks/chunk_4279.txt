Coccydynia can be caused by a number of factors.
Usually, patients report pain after a fall onto their but-
tocks, as occurs when going down stairs or while skating.
Others have pain during pregnancy or after childbirth.
Some experience repetitive strain from rowing or cycling,
and some cite anal intercourse as the cause of pain. In
many cases, pain derives from a malformation of the coc-
cyx itself. Sometimes bony spurs appear on the coccyx,
but only seem to be painful in thin patients who do not
have the padding to protect the region from the spur.
Other causes of coccydynia include cancer or dam-
age to the sacrum that generates referred pain, meaning
pain that appears in one region but originates from anoth-
er. Muscle strain or tension, pinched nerves or damaged
nerves, or dislocation of the coccyx due to gross obesity
are other causes.

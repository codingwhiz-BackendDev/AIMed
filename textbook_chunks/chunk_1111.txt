Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning occurs when car-
bon monoxide gas is inhaled. CO is a colorless, odorless,
highly poisonous gas that is produced by incomplete
combustion. It is found in automobile exhaust fumes,
faulty stoves and heating systems, fires, and cigarette
smoke. Other sources include woodburning stoves,
kerosene heaters, improperly ventilated water heaters
and gas stoves, and blocked or poorly maintained chim-
ney flues. CO interferes with the ability of the blood to
carry oxygen. The result is headache, nausea, convul-
sions, and finally death by asphyxiation.

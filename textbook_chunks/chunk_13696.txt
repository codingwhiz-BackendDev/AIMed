of adult botulism appear about 18–36
hours after the contaminated food is eaten, although
there are documented times of onset ranging from four
hours to eight days. Initially a person suffering from bot-
ulism feels weakness and dizziness followed by double
vision. Symptoms progress to difficulty speaking and
swallowing. Paralysis moves down the body, and when
the respiratory muscles are paralyzed, death results from
asphyxiation. People who show any signs of botulism
poisoning must receive immediate emergency medical
care to increase their chance of survival.
Infant botulism is a form of botulism first recog-
nized in 1976. It differs from food-borne botulism in its
causes and symptoms. Infant botulism occurs when a
child under the age of one year ingests the spores of C.
botulinum. These spores are found in soil, but a more
common source of spores is honey.
The C. botulinum spores lodge in the baby’s intesti-
nal tract and begin to grow, producing their neurotoxin.
Onset of symptoms is gradual. Initially the baby is consti-
pated. This is followed by poor feeding, lethargy, weak-
ness, drooling, and a distinctive wailing cry. Eventually,
the baby loses the ability to control its head muscles.
From there the paralysis progresses to the rest of the body.

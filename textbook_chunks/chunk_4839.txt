Autoimmune diseases—A group of diseases, like
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythe-
matosus, in which immune cells turn on the body,
attacking various tissues and organs.
Hereditary angioedema—A complement deficien-
cy characterized by lymphatic vessel blockages
that cause temporary swelling (edema) of areas of
the skin, mucous membranes, and, sometimes,
internal organs.
Leucocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome—A
complement deficiency syndrome characterized
by recurrent infections of the skin, mucous mem-
branes, and gastrointestinal tract and the absence
of pus formation. This disorder is sometimes
apparent at birth when separation of the umbilical
cord takes longer than normal.
Meningitis—An inflammation of the lining sur-
rounding the brain and spinal cord.
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)—A
rare complement disorder characterized by
episodes of red blood cell destruction (hemolysis)
and blood in the urine (hemoglobinuria) that is
worse at night.
Systemic lupus erythematosus—An autoimmune
disease in which the immune system attacks the
body’s connective tissue. A butterfly-shaped facial
rash is characteristic.
White blood cells—Cells that are key in immune
defense. There are various types, including those
that engulf and kill invading bacteria.
ple remain healthy with no symptoms at all. Others, who
suffer from frequent infections, may develop a high fever,
diarrhea, headaches with a stiff neck, or a cough with
chest pain. If an autoimmune disease develops, like lupus,
the person may lose weight, suffer from a rash, and have
joint pain. Other symptoms of complement deficiency dis-
eases (like hereditary angioedema, paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria, or leukocyte adhesion deficiency syn-
drome) include abdominal and back pain, skin infections,
edema or swelling of the face and red bumps on the skin.

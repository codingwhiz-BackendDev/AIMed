Aerobic exercise can lower blood pressure, help con-
trol weight, and increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol. It may
keep the blood vessels more flexible. The Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention and the American College of
Sports Medicine recommend moderate to intense aerobic
exercise lasting about 30 minutes four or more times per
week for maximum heart health. Three 10-minute exercise
periods are also beneficial. Aerobic exercise—activities
such as walking, jogging, and cycling—uses the large mus-
cle groups and forces the body to use oxygen more effi-
ciently. It can also include everyday activities such as active
gardening, climbing stairs, or brisk housework. People with
coronary artery disease or risk factors should consult a doc-
tor before beginning an exercise program.

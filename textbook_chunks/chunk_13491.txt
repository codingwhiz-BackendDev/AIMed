No vaccines have been developed that are effective
against lung or liver fluke infections. Prevention of these
infections includes the following measures:
• boiling or purifying drinking water
• avoiding raw or undercooked fish or salads made from
fresh aquatic plants; all food eaten in areas with fluke
infestations should be cooked thoroughly; pickling or
smoking will not kill fluke cysts in fish or shellfish
• control or eradication of the snails that serve as the
flukes’ intermediate hosts

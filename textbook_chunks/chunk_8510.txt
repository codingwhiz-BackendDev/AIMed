â€¢ Diarrhea medicine or cholesterol-lowering drugs such as
cholestyramine (Questran) and colestipol (Colestid) may
keep digitalis medicines from being absorbed into the
body. To prevent this problem, digitalis drugs should be
taken several hours before or after taking these medicines.
The list above does not include every drug that may
interact with digitalis drugs. Be sure to check with a
physician or pharmacist before taking any other prescrip-
tion or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine.
In addition, a diet high in fiber may interfere with
the effects of digitalis drugs by preventing the medicine
from being absorbed into the body. To avoid this prob-
lem, eat high fiber foods (such as bran products, whole
wheat bread, and fresh fruits and vegetables) several
hours before or after taking digitalis medicine.

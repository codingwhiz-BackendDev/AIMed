Although this test is not always necessary, it may be
used to distinguish between a pituitary adenoma and an
ectopic source of ACTH. Petrosal sinus sampling involves
drawing blood directly from veins that drain the pituitary.
This test, which is usually performed with local anesthe-
sia and mild sedation, requires inserting tiny, flexible
tubes (catheters) through a vein in the upper thigh or
groin area. The catheters are then threaded up slowly until
they reach veins in an area of the skull known as the pet-
rosal sinuses. X rays are typically used to confirm the cor-
rect position of the catheters. Often CRH is also given
during the test to increase the accuracy of results.
When blood tested from the petrosal sinuses reveals
a higher ACTH level than blood drawn from a vein in the
forearm, the likely diagnosis is a pituitary adenoma.
When the two samples show similar levels of ACTH, the
diagnosis indicates ectopic ACTH syndrome.

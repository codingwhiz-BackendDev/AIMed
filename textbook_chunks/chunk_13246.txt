None

Distal—Movement away from the origin.
Flex—To bend.
Laceration—A cut in the skin
Phalanx—A bone of the fingers or toes.
Tendon—A structure that connects a skeletal mus-
cle to bone.
healthy tissue will usually grow and replace the injured
area. Larger wounds may require surgical intervention.
Puncture wounds should be cleaned and left open to heal.
Patients typically receive antibiotics to prevent infec-
tion. A procedure called trephining treats subungal
hematomas. This procedure is usually done with a
straight cutting needle positioned over the nail. The clini-
cian spins the needle with forefinger and thumb until a
hole is made through the nail.
Patients who have extensive crush injuries or subun-
gal hematomas involving laceration to skin folds or nail
damage should have the nail removed to examine the
underlying tissue (called the matrix). Patients who have a
closed subungal hematoma with an intact nail and no
other damage (no nail disruption or laceration) are treat-
ed conservatively. If the fracture is located two-thirds
below the fingertip immobilization using a splint may be
needed. Conservative treatment is recommended for
crush injuries that fracture the terminal phalanx if a sub-
ungal hematoma is not present. Severe fractures near the
fist circular skin crease may require surgical correction
to prevent irregularity of the joint surface, which can
cause difficulty with movement. Injury to a flexor tendon
usually requires surgical repair. If this is not possible, the
finger and wrist should be placed in a splint with specific
positioning to prevent further damage.

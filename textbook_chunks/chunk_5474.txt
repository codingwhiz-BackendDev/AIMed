• Burdock (Arctium lappa) minimizes inflammation and
boosts the immune system. It is taken internally as a tea
or tincture (a concentrated herbal extract prepared with
alcohol).
• Calendula (Calendula officinalis) is a natural antiseptic
and anti-inflammatory agent. It is applied topically in a
lotion, ointment, or oil to the affected area.
• Aloe (Aloe barbadensis) soothes skin irritations. The
gel is applied topically to the affected area.
A homeopath treating a patient with contact dermati-
tis will do a thorough investigation of the individual’s his-
tory and exposures before prescribing a remedy. One
homeopathic remedy commonly prescribed to relieve the
itching associated with contact dermatitis is Rhus toxico-
dendron taken internally three to four times daily.
Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are common
culprits in cases of allergic contact dermatitis. Following
exposure to these plants, rash development may be prevent-
ed by washing the area with soap and water within 15 min-
utes of exposure. The leaves of jewelweed (Impatiens spp.),
which often grows near poison ivy, may neutralize the poi-
son-ivy allergen if rubbed on the skin right after contact.
Several topical remedies may help relieve the itching asso-
ciated with allergic contact dermatitis, including the juice
of plantain leaves (Plantago major); a paste made of equal
parts of green clay and goldenseal root (Hydrastis
canadensis); a paste made of salt, water, clay, and pepper-
mint (Mentha piperita) oil; and calamine lotion.

A surgeon performs a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on a

operative site is observed for color and amount of wound
drainage. Fluids are given intravenously for 24–48 hours,
until the patient’s diet is gradually advanced as bowel activi-
ty resumes. The patient is generally encouraged to walk 8
hours after surgery and is discharged from the hospital with-
in three to five days, with return to work approximately four
to six weeks after the procedure.
Care received immediately after laparoscopic cholecys-
tectomy is similar to that of any patient undergoing surgery
with general anesthesia. A unique post-operative pain may
be experienced in the right shoulder related to pressure from
carbon dioxide used through the laparoscopic tubes. This
pain may be relieved by laying on the left side with right
knee and thigh drawn up to the chest. Walking will also help
increase the body’s reabsorption of the gas. The patient is
usually discharged the day after surgery, and allowed to
shower on the second postoperative day. The patient is
advised to gradually resume normal activities over a three
day period, while avoiding heavy lifting for about 10 days.

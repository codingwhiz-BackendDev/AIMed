The outlook for patients with FUO depends on the
cause of the fever. If the basic illness is easily treatable
and can be found rather quickly, the potential for a cure
is quite good. Some patients continue with temperature
elevations for six months or more; if no serious disease is
found, medications such as NSAIDs are used to decrease
the effects of the fever. Careful follow-up and reevalua-
tion is recommended in these cases.

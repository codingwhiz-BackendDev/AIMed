Cholesterol is the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of medi-
cine, since it has both a good side and bad side. It is nec-
essary to digest fats from food, make hormones, build cell
walls, and participate in other processes for maintaining a
healthy body. When people talk about cholesterol as a
medical problem, they are usually referring to high cho-
lesterol. This can be somewhat misleading, since there are
four components to cholesterol. These are:
• LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol
• HDL, the so-called good cholesterol
• triglycerides, a blood fat lipid that increases the risk for
heart disease
• total cholesterol
High LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is a major con-
tributing factor of heart disease. The cholesterol forms
plaque in the heart’s blood vessels, which restricts or
blocks the supply of blood to the heart, and causes a
condition called atherosclerosis. This can lead to a
“heart attack,” resulting in damage to the heart and pos-
sibly death. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) estimates that 90 million American adults,
roughly half the adult population, have elevated choles-
terol levels.
The population as a whole is at some risk of devel-
oping high LDL cholesterol in their lifetimes. Specific
risk factors include a family history of high choles-
terol, obesity, heart attack or stroke, alcoholism, and
lack of regular exercise. The chances of developing
high cholesterol increase after the age of 45. One of the
primary causes of high LDL cholesterol is too much fat
or sugar in the diet, a problem especially true in the
United States. Cholesterol is also produced naturally in
the liver and overproduction may occur even in people
who limit their intake of high cholesterol food. Low
HDL and high triglyceride levels are also risk factors
for atherosclerosis.

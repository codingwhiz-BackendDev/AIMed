Diaphragms are dome-shaped barrier methods of
contraception that block sperm from entering the uterus.
They are made of latex (rubber) and formed like a shal-
low cup. Since vaginas vary in size, each patient will
need to be fitted by a doctor or nurse with a diaphragm
that conforms to the shape and contour of the vagina as
well as the strength of the muscles in the vaginal walls.
Diaphragms must be used with spermicidal cream or
jelly. The device should cause no discomfort, and neither
the woman nor her partner should feel that it is there.

An accurate diagnosis of conjunctivitis centers on
taking a patient history to learn when symptoms began,
how long the condition has been going on, the symptoms
experienced, and other predisposing factors, such as
upper respiratory complaints, allergies, sexually trans-
mitted diseases, herpes simplex infections, and exposure
to persons with pink eye. It may be helpful to learn
whether an aspect of an individualâ€™s occupation may be
the cause, for example, welding. Diagnostic tests are usu-
ally not indicated unless initial treatment fails or an infec-
tion with gonorrhea or chlamydia is suspected. In such
cases, the discharge may be cultured and Gram stained to
determine the organism responsible for causing the condi-
tion. Cultures and smears are relatively painless.

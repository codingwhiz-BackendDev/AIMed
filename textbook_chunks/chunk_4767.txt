Colds make the upper respiratory system less resis-
tant to bacterial infection. Secondary bacterial infection
may lead to middle ear infection, bronchitis, pneumo-
nia, sinus infection, or strep throat. People with chronic
lung disease, asthma, diabetes, or a weakened immune
system are more likely to develop these complications.

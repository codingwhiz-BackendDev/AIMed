The patient puts on a surgical gown and lies down on
the examining table. The procedure, which takes between
30–60 minutes, may be conducted one of three ways:
• Skin electrodes. This is the most commonly used method
of recording information. The skin where the electrodes
will be placed is cleaned and shaved and an electrically
conductive paste is applied. The electrodes are then taped
in place. For female patients, the electrodes are taped
around the urethra, while for male patients they are
placed between the scrotum and the anus.
• Needle electrodes. This is considered the most accurate
method, since the electrodes are inserted directly into
the muscle, using needles to guide placement. For male
patients, a gloved finger is inserted in the rectum, then
needles with wires attached are inserted through the
skin between the anus and the scrotum. For female

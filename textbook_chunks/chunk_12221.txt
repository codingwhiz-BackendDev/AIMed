Treatment of factitious disorders is usually limited
to prompt recognition of the condition and the refusal to
give unnecessary medications or to perform unneeded
procedures. Factitious disorder patients do not usually
remain in the hospital long enough for effective psychi-
atric treatment. Some clinicians have tried psychothera-
peutic treatment for factitious disorder patients, and there
are anecdotal reports that antidepressant or antipsychotic
medications are helpful in certain cases.

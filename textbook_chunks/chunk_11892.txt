Cataracts—A clouding of the lens of the eye or the
material immediately surrounding it, causing
blurred vision. For many people it occurs naturally
with aging, but may also result from injury.
Glaucoma—A common eye disease characterized
by increased fluid pressure in the eye that dam-
ages the optic nerve, which carries sensations to
the brain. Glaucoma can be caused by another
eye disorder, such as a tumor or congenital mal-
formation, or appear without obvious cause, but if
untreated it generally leads to blindness.
Intraocular—Literally, within the eye.
Ophthalmologist—A medical doctor specializing
in eye care who is generally, but not necessarily,
an eye surgeon.
Retina—The third and innermost membrane of the
eye, which contains the light-sensitive nerve tissue
that leads into the optic nerve and is the primary
instument of vision. Inflammation of the retina
(retinitis) has many causes, including over-expo-
sure to intense light, diabetes, and syphilis.

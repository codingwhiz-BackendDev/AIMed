Normal color vision requires the use of specialized
receptor cells called cones, which are located in the reti-
na of the eye. There are three types of cones, termed red,
blue, and green, which enable people to see a wide spec-
trum of colors. An abnormality, or deficiency, of any of
the types of cones will result in abnormal color vision.
There are three basic variants of color blindness.
Red/green color blindness (deuteranopia) is the most
common deficiency, affecting 8% of Caucasian males
and 0.5% of Caucasian females. The prevalence varies
with culture.
Blue color blindness (protanopia) is an inability to
distinguish both blue and yellow, which are seen as white
or gray. Protanopia is quite rare and has equal prevalence
in males and females. It is common for young children to
have blue/green confusion that becomes less pronounced
in adulthood. Blue color deficiency often appears in peo-
ple who have physical disorders such as liver disease or
diabetes mellitus.
A total inability to distinguish colors (achromatop-
sia) is exceedingly rare. These affected individuals view
the world in shades of gray. They frequently have poor
visual acuity and are extremely sensitive to light (photo-
phobia), which causes them to squint in ordinary light.
Researchers studying red/green color blindness in
the United Kingdom reported an average prevalence of
only 4.7% in one group. Only 1% of Eskimo males are
color blind. Approximately 2.9% of boys from Saudi
Arabia and 3.7% from India were found to have deficient
color vision. Red/green color blindness may slightly
increase an affected personâ€™s chances of contracting lep-
rosy. Pre-term infants exhibit an increased prevalence of
blue color blindness. Achromatopsia has a prevalence of
about 1 in 33,000 in the United States and affects males
and females equally.

Potential problems associated with open cholecys-
tectomy include respiratory problems related to location
of the incision, wound infection, or abscess formation.
Possible complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy
include accidental puncture of the bowel or bladder and
uncontrolled bleeding. Incomplete reabsorption of the
carbon dioxide gas could irritate the muscles used in res-
piration and cause respiratory distress.

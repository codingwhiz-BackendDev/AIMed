A deviated septum can be a simple variation in nor-
mal structure or the result of a broken nose. Any narrow-
ing of the nasal passageway that it causes will threaten
the drainage of secretions from the sinuses, which must
pass through the nose. It is a general rule of medicine
that when flow is obstructed, whether it is mucus from
the sinuses or bile from the gall bladder, infection results.
People with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) are at greater
risk of obstruction because their nasal passageways are
already narrowed by the swollen membranes lining them.
The result is sinusitis, which can be acute and severe or
chronic and lingering.

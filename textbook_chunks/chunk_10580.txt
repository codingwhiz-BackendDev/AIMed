Endometriosis is estimated to affect 7% of women of
childbearing age in the United States. It most commonly
strikes between the ages of 25 and 40. Endometriosis can
also appear in the teen years, but never before the start of
menstruation. It is seldom seen in postmenopausal
women.
Endometriosis was once called the “career woman’s
disease” because it was thought to be a product of
delayed childbearing. The statistics defy such a narrow
generalization; however, pregnancy may slow the
progress of the condition. A more important predictor of
a woman’s risk is if her female relatives have endome-
triosis. Another influencing factor is the length of a
woman’s menstrual cycle. Women whose periods last
longer than a week with an interval of less than 27 days
between them seem to be more prone to the condition.
Endometrial implants are most often found on the
pelvic organs—the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and in
the cavity behind the uterus. Occasionally, this tissue
grows in such distant parts of the body as the lungs, arms,
and kidneys. Newly formed implants appear as small
bumps on the surfaces of the organs and supporting liga-
ments and are sometimes said to look like “powder burns.”
Ovarian cysts may form around endometrial tissue
(endometriomas) and may range from pea to grapefruit
size. Endometriosis is a progressive condition that usually
advances slowly, over the course of many years. Doctors
rank cases from minimal to severe based on factors such as
the number and size of the endometrial implants, their
appearance and location, and the extent of the scar tissue
and adhesions in the vicinity of the growths.

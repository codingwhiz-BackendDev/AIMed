Cystitis is defined as inflammation of the urinary blad-
der. Urethritis is an inflammation of the urethra, which is
the passageway that connects the bladder with the exterior
of the body. Sometimes cystitis and urethritis are referred
to collectively as a lower urinary tract infection, or UTI.
Infection of the upper urinary tract involves the spread of
bacteria to the kidney and is called pyelonephritis.

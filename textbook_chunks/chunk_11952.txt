noted the infant can be seen, generally by a pediatric oph-
thalmologist. A child with no symptoms should have an
eye exam at age three. Early exams are important because
permanent decreases in vision (e.g., amblyopia, also
called lazy eye) can occur if not treated early (usually by
ages 6–9). Again, with no other symptoms, the second
exam should take place before first grade. After first
grade, the American Optometric Association recom-
mends an eye exam every two years; ages 19–40, every
two to three years; ages 41–60, every two years; and
annually after that. However, these are recommendations
for healthy people with no risk factors. Patients should
ask their doctors how often they should come for exams.
Some patients have risk factors for eye disease (e.g., peo-
ple with diabetes or a family history of eye disease;
African Americans, who are at higher risk for glaucoma)
and may need more frequent checkups. Also, if children
seem to be having trouble in school, problems with read-
ing, rubbing their eyes when reading, etc., an eye exam
may be necessary sooner.

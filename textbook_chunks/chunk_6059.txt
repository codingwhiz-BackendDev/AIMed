After teeth are bleached, they may darken faster if
exposed to staining products such as coffee or tobacco.
Some patients experience increased sensitivity to cold
while teeth are being bleached, but the sensitivity usually
disappears shortly after completion of the treatment.
Bonded teeth, like bleached teeth, may also stain
more easily than natural teeth. Bonding materials also
chip easily.

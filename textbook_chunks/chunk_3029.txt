Therapeutic approaches that encourage self-discov-
ery and empowerment may be useful in treating some
childhood emotional traumas and mental disorders. Art
therapy, the use of the creative process to express and
understand emotion, encompasses a broad range of
humanistic disciplines, including visual arts, dance,
drama, music, film, writing, literature, and other artistic
genres. It can be particularly effective in children who
may have difficulty gaining insight to emotions and
thoughts they are otherwise incapable of expressing.
Certain mild herbal remedies may also be safely
used with children, such as ginger (Zingiber officinale)
tea for nausea and aloe vera salve for burns. Parents and
caregivers should always consult their healthcare
provider before administering herbs to children.

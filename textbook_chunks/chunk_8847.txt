The prognosis for people with diverticula is excel-
lent, with only 20% of such patients ever seeking any
medical help for their condition.
While diverticulitis can be a difficult and painful dis-
ease, it is usually quite treatable. Prognosis is worse for
individuals who have other medical problems, particular-
ly those requiring the use of steroid medications, which
increase the chances of developing a serious infection.
Prognosis is also worse in the elderly.

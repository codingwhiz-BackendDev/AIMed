If the endometrium is not developing at the appro-
priate rate, the results are said to be “out-of-phase” or
abnormal. The endometrium has not developed appropri-
ately and cannot support a pregnancy. This condition is
called luteal phase defect and may need to be treated
with progesterone.
Abnormal appearance of the cells forming the uter-
ine tissue could also indicate uterine cancer, or the pres-
ence of fibroids or polyps in the uterus.

The two main ways to control this disease are to take
DEC preventively, which has shown to be effective, and
to reduce the number of carrier insects in a particular area.
Avoiding mosquito bites with insecticides and insect
repellents is helpful, as is wearing protective clothing
and using bed netting.
Much effort has been made in cleaning the breeding
sites (stagnant water) of mosquitoes near peopleâ€™s homes
in areas where filariasis is found.
Before visiting countries where lymphatic filariasis
is found, it would be wise to consult a travel physician to
learn about current preventative measures.

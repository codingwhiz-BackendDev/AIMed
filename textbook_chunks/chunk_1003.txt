Also known as invasive candidiasis, deep organ candidi-
asis is a serious systemic infection that can affect the esopha-
gus, heart, blood, liver, spleen, kidneys, eyes, and skin. Like
vaginal and oral candidiasis, it is an opportunistic disease
that strikes when a personâ€™s resistance is lowered, often due
to another illness. There are many diagnostic categories of
deep organ candidiasis, depending on the tissues involved.

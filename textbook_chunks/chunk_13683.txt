of food poisoning from E. coli are slower
to appear than those caused by some of the other food-
borne bacteria. E. coli produces toxins in the large intes-
tine rather than higher up in the digestive system. This
accounts for the delay in symptoms and the fact that
vomiting rarely occurs in E. coli food poisoning.
One to three days after eating contaminated food, the
victim with E. coli O157:H7 begins to have severe abdom-
inal cramps and watery diarrhea that usually becomes
bloody within 24 hours. There is little or no fever, and
rarely does the victim vomit. The bloody, watery diarrhea
lasts from one to eight days in uncomplicated cases.
Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni)
According to the FDA, C. jejuni is the leading cause of
bacterial diarrhea in the United States. It is responsible for
more cases of bacterial diarrhea than Shigella and Salmo-
nella combined. Anyone can get food poisoning from C.
jejuni, but children under five and young adults between
the ages of 15 and 29 are more frequently infected.
C. jejuni is carried by healthy cattle, chickens, birds,
and flies. It is not carried by healthy people in the United
States or Europe. The bacteria is also found ponds and
stream water. The ingestion of only a few hundred C.
jejuni bacteria can make a person sick.

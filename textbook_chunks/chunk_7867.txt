Contact dermatitis can be prevented by avoiding the
source of irritation. If the irritant cannot be avoided com-
pletely, the patient should wear gloves and other protec-
tive clothing whenever exposure is likely to occur.
Immediately washing the exposed area with soap
and water can stem allergic reactions to poison ivy, poi-
son oak, or poison sumac, but because soaps can dry the
skin, patients susceptible to dermatitis should use them
only on the face, feet, genitals, and underarms.
Clothing should be loose fitting and 100% cotton.
New clothing should be washed in dye-free, unscented
detergent before being worn.
Injury to the lower leg can cause stasis dermatitis to
ulcerate (form open sores). If stasis ulcers develop, a
doctor should be notified immediately.
Yoga and other relaxation techniques may help pre-
vent atopic dermatitis caused by stress.
Avoidance of sweating may aid in preventing sebor-
rheic dermatitis.
A patient who has dermatitis should also notify a
doctor if any of the following occurs:
• fever develops
• skin oozes or other signs of infection appear
• symptoms do not begin to subside after seven days’
treatment
• he/she comes into contact with someone who has a
wart, cold sore, or other viral skin infection

Do not take antacids that contain aluminum, calci-
um, or magnesium at the same time as fluoroquinolones.
The antacids may keep the fluoroquinolones from work-
ing as they should. If antacids are needed, take them at
least two hours before or two hours after taking nor-
floxacin or ofloxacin, at least four hours before or two
hours after taking ciprofloxacin. Follow the same
instructions for taking sucralfate (Carafate), a medicine
used to treat stomach ulcers and other irritation in the
digestive tract and mouth.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to fluoro-
quinolones or related medicines such as cinoxacin
(Cinobac) or nalidixic acid (NegGram) in the past should
let his or her physician know before taking the drugs
again. The physician should also be told about any aller-
gies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
Before using fluoroquinolones, people with any of
these medical problems should make sure their physi-
cians are aware of their conditions:
• kidney disease
• liver disease with kidney disease
• diseases of the brain or spinal cord, including harden-
ing of the arteries in the brain, epilepsy, and other
seizure disorders
Taking fluoroquinolones with certain other drugs
may affect the way the drugs work or may increase the
chance of side effects.

Hormone therapy is standard treatment for some
types of cancers that are hormone-dependent and grow
faster in the presence of particular hormones. These
include cancer of the prostate, breast, and uterus. Hor-
mone therapy involves blocking the production or action
of these hormones. As a result the growth of the tumor
slows down and survival may be extended for several
months or years.

of chronic or disseminated coccidioidomy-
cosis is made by culturing a sample of sputum or other
body fluids in the laboratory to isolate the fungus. A blood
serum test is used to detect the presence of an antibody pro-
duced in response to C. immitis infection. Chest x rays are
often used to assess lung damage, but alone cannot lead to
a definitive diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis because other
diseases can produce similar results on the x ray.

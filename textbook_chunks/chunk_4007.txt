The best way to prevent clenched fist injuries is to
avoid fist fights, intoxication, and association with peo-
ple who practice these forms of behavior. If involved in a
fistfight, people should avoid directing punches at their
opponentâ€™s mouth. The next best preventive measure is to
get medical treatment at once for a clenched-fist injury.

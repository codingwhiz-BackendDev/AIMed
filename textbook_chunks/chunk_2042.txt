The procedure to remove cerebrospinal fluid is
called a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, because the area
of the spinal column used to obtain the sample is in the
lumbar spine, or lower section of the back. In rare
instances, such as a spinal fluid blockage in the middle of
the back, a doctor may perform a spinal tap in the neck.
The lower lumbar spine (usually between the vertebrae
known as L4–5) is preferable because the spinal cord
stops near L2, and a needle introduced below this level
will miss the spinal cord and encounter only nerve roots,
which are easily pushed aside.
A lumbar puncture takes about 30 minutes. Patients
can undergo the test in a doctor’s office, laboratory, or
outpatient hospital setting. Sometimes it requires an
inpatient hospital stay. If the patient has spinal arthritis,
is extremely uncooperative, or obese, it may be necessary
to introduce the spinal needle using x-ray guidance.
In order to get an accurate sample of cerebrospinal
fluid, it is critical that a patient is in the proper position.
The spine must be curved to allow as much space as possi-

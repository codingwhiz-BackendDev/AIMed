Dementia is marked by a gradual impoverishment of
thought and other mental activities. Losses eventually
affect virtually every aspect of mental life. The slow pro-
gression of dementia is in contrast with delirium, which
involves some of the same symptoms, but has a very
rapid onset and fluctuating course with alteration in the
level of consciousness. However, delirium may occur
with dementia, especially since the person with dementia
is more susceptible to the delirium-inducing effects of
may types of drugs.

The catecholamines test can be performed on either
blood or urine. If performed on blood, the test may
require one or two samples, depending on the physicianâ€™s
request. The first blood sample will be drawn after the
patient has been lying down in a warm, comfortable
environment for at least 30 minutes. If a second sample is
needed, the patient will be asked to stand for 10 minutes
before the blood is drawn. Instead of a venipuncture,
which can be stressful for the patient, possibly increasing
catecholamine levels in the blood, a plastic or rubber
tube-like device called a catheter may be used to collect
the blood samples. The catheter would be inserted in a
vein 24 hours in advance, eliminating the need for needle
punctures at the time of the test.
It may take up to a week for a lab to complete testing
of the samples. Because blood levels of catecholamines
commonly go up and down in response to such factors as
temperature, stress, postural change, diet, smoking, obe-
sity, and many drugs, abnormally high blood test results
should be confirmed with a 24-hour urine test. In addition,
catecholamine secretion from a tumor may not be steady,
but may occur periodically during the day, and potentially
could be missed when blood testing is used. The urine test
provides the laboratory with a specimen that reflects cate-
cholamine production over an entire 24-hour period. If
urine is tested, the patient or a healthcare worker must col-
lect all the urine passed over the 24-hour period.

Alternative therapy is not meant to replace conven-
tional medical treatment, but it can be a useful adjunct. Its
main roles are to relieve tension, manage pain, and
strengthen neck and back muscles. Massage is one way to
relieve tension, and yoga provides the additional benefit
of strengthening muscles. Chiropractic and acupunc-
ture have been reported to relieve the pain associated
with disk problems, although great care needs to be taken
to avoid exacerbating them. Practitioners of the Alexan-
der technique or the Feldenkrais method can provide
instruction on correct posture and exercise that may help
prevent further symptoms. Vitamin and mineral supple-
mentation along with herbal therapies and homeopathy
can help build and rebalance the weakened structure.

decreasing or increasing the
flow of blood from the body’s core, where it is warmed,
to the surface, where it is cooled; slowing down or speed-
ing up the rate at which the body turns food into energy
(metabolic rate); inducing shivering, which generates heat
through muscle contraction; and inducing sweating,
which cools the body through evaporation.
A fever occurs when the thermostat resets at a higher
temperature, primarily in response to an infection. To
reach the higher temperature, the body moves blood to
the warmer interior, increases the metabolic rate, and
induces shivering. The “chills” that often accompany a
fever are caused by the movement of blood to the body’s
core, leaving the surface and extremities cold. Once the
higher temperature is achieved, the shivering and chills
stop. When the infection has been overcome or drugs
such as aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol) have been
taken, the thermostat resets to normal and the body’s
cooling mechanisms switch on: the blood moves to the
surface and sweating occurs.
Fever is an important component of the immune
response, though its role is not completely understood.
Physicians believe that an elevated body temperature has
several effects. The immune system chemicals that react
with the fever-inducing agent and trigger the resetting of
the thermostat also increase the production of cells that
fight off the invading bacteria or viruses. Higher temper-
atures also inhibit the growth of some bacteria, while at
the same time speeding up the chemical reactions that
help the body’s cells repair themselves. In addition, the
increased heart rate that may accompany the changes in
blood circulation also speeds the arrival of white blood
cells to the sites of infection.

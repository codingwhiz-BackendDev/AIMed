Spiral CT, also called helical CT, is a newer version
of CT scanning which is continuous in motion and
allows for three-dimensional recreation of images. For
example, traditional CT allows the technologist to take
slices at very small and precise intervals one after the
other. Spiral CT allows for a continuous flow of images,
without stopping the scanner to move to the next image
slice. A major advantage of spiral CT is the ability to
reconstruct images anywhere along the length of the
study area. The procedure also speeds up the imaging
process, meaning less time for the patient to lie still. The
ability to image contrast more rapidly after it is injected,
when it is at its highest level, is another advantage of spi-
ral CTâ€™s high speed.
Some facilities will have both spiral and convention-
al CT available. Although spiral is more advantageous
for many applications, conventional CT is still a superior
and precise method for imaging many tissues and struc-
tures. The physician will evaluate which type of CT
works best for the specific exam purpose.

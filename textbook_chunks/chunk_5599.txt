Cooling treatments lower body temperature in order
to relieve pain, swelling, constriction of blood vessels,
and to decrease the liklihood of cellular damage by slow-
ing the metabolism. Sponge baths, cold compresses, and
cold packs are all wet cooling treatments. Dry treat-
ments, such as ice bags and chemical cold packs, are also
used to lower body temperature.

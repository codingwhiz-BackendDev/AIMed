A chest x ray is a procedure used to evaluate organs
and structures within the chest for symptoms of disease.
Chest x rays include views of the lungs, heart, small por-
tions of the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid gland and the
bones of the chest area. X rays are a form of radiation
that can penetrate the body and produce an image on an
x-ray film. Another name for x ray is radiograph.

The usual physical abuse scenario involves a parent
who loses control and lashes out at a child. The trigger
may be normal child behavior such as crying or dirtying
a diaper. Unlike nonabusive parents, who may become
angry at or upset with their children from time to time
but are genuinely loving, abusive parents tend to harbor
deep-rooted negative feelings toward their children.
Unexplained or suspicious bruises or other marks
on the skin are typical signs of physical abuse, as are
burns. Skull and other bone fractures are often seen
in young abused children, and in fact, head injuries are
the leading cause of death from abuse. Children less
than one year old are particularly vulnerable to injury
from shaking. This is called shaken baby syndrome
or shaken impact syndrome. Not surprisingly, physical
abuse also causes a wide variety of behavioral changes
in children.

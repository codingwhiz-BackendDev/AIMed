Ear surgery for a perforated eardrum is only per-
formed in rare cases where it does not heal on its own. In
most cases, this is performed in a surgeon’s office using a
topical anesthetic. The surgeon scratches the undersur-
face of the eardrum, stimulating the skin to heal and the
eardrum to close. A thin patch placed on the eardrum’s
outer surface allows the skin under the eardrum to heal.

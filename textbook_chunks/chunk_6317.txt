The most obvious pathologic feature of CJD is the
formation of numerous fluid-filled spaces in the brain
(vacuoles) resulting in a sponge-like appearance. CJD is
one of several human “spongiform encephalopathies,”
diseases that produce this characteristic change in brain
tissue. Others are kuru; Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
disease, a genetic predominantly characterized by cere-
bellar ataxia (a kind of movement disorder); and fatal
familial insomnia, associated with progressive insomnia,
autonomic system disfunction, and weakness caused by
motor system dysfunction.
Kuru was prevalent among the Fore people in Papua,
New Guinea, and spread from infected individuals after
their deaths through the practice of ritual cannibalism, in
which the relatives of the dead person honored him by
consuming his organs, including the brain. Discovery of
the infectious nature of kuru won the Nobel Prize for
Carleton Gadjusek in 1976. The incubation period for
kuru was between four to 30 years or more. While kuru
has virtually disappeared following the cessation of these
cannibalistic practices, several new cases continue to
arise each year.

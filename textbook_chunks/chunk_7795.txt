In addition to an interview, several clinical invento-
ries or scales may be used to assess a patientâ€™s mental
status and determine the presence of depressive symp-
toms. Among these tests are: the Hamilton Depression
Scale (HAM-D), Child Depression Inventory (CDI),
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI), and the Zung Self-Rating Scale for
Depression. These tests may be administered in an out-
patient or hospital setting by a general practitioner, social
worker, psychiatrist, or psychologist.

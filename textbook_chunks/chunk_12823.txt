The incidence of FAS varies among different popu-
lations studied, and ranges from approximately one in
200 to one in 2000 at birth. However, a recent study
reported in 1997, utilizing the Institute of Medicine crite-
ria, estimated the prevalence in Seattle, Washington from
1975–1981 at nearly one in 100 live births. Avoiding
alcohol during pregnancy, including the earliest weeks of
the pregnancy can prevent FAS. There is no amount of
alcohol use during pregnancy that has been proven to be
completely safe.
There is no racial or ethnic predilection for FAS.
Individuals from different genetic backgrounds exposed
to similar amounts of alcohol during pregnancy may
exhibit different signs or symptoms of FAS. Several stud-
ies have estimated that between 25–45% of chronic alco-
holic women will give birth to a child with FAS if they
continue to drink during pregnancy. The risk of FAS
appears to increase as a chronic alcoholic woman pro-
gresses in her childbearing years and continues to drink.
That is, a child with FAS will often be one of the last
born to a chronic alcoholic woman, although older sib-
lings may exhibit milder features of FAS. Binge drink-
ing, defined as sporadic use of five or more standard
alcoholic drinks per occasion, and “moderate” daily
drinking (two to four 12 oz bottles of beer, eight to 16
ounces of wine, two to four ounces of liquor) can also
result in offspring with features of FAS.

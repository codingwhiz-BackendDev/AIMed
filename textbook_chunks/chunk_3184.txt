The above symptoms alone are very suggestive of
cholangitis; however, it is important to determine the exact
cause and site of possible obstruction. This is because
attacks are likely to recur, and different causes require dif-
ferent treatments. For example, the treatment of cholangi-
tis due to a stone in the CBD is different from that due to
bile duct strictures. An elevated white blood count sug-
gests infection, but may be normal in 20% of patients.
Abnormal or elevated tests of liver function, such as biliru-
bin and others are also frequently present. The specific
bacteria is sometimes identified from blood cultures.
X-ray techniques
A number of x-ray techniques can make the diagno-
sis of bile duct obstruction; these include ultrasound and
computed tomography scans (CT scans). However,
ultrasound often cannot tell if an obstruction is due to a
stricture or stone, missing a stone in about half the cases.
CT scans have an even poorer record of stone detection.
Another method of diagnosing and sometimes treat-
ing the cause of bile duct obstruction or narrowing is
called percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. In
this procedure, dye is injected into the ducts by means of

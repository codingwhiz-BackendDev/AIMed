• Complete remission or response. The cancer complete-
ly disappears. The course of chemotherapy is complet-
ed and the patient is tested regularly for a recurrence.
• Partial remission or response. The cancer shrinks in
size but does not disappear. The same chemotherapy
may be continued or a different combination of drugs
may be tried.
• Stabilization. The cancer does not grow or shrink.
Other therapy options may be explored. A tumor may
stay stabilized for many years.
• Progression. The cancer continues to grow. Other thera-
py options may be explored.
• A secondary malignancy may develop from the one
being treated, and that second cancer may need addi-
tional chemotherapy or other treatment.

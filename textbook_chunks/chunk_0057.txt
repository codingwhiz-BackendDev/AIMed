A preliminary list of diseases, disorders, tests and treat-
ments was compiled from a wide variety of sources,
including professional medical guides and textbooks as
well as consumer guides and encyclopedias. The general
advisory board, made up of public librarians, medical
librarians and consumer health experts, evaluated the top-
ics and made suggestions for inclusion. The list was sorted
by category and sent to GEM2 medical advisors, certified
physicians with various medical specialities, for review.
Final selection of topics to include was made by the med-
ical advisors in conjunction with the Gale Group editor.

Contributing risk factors have been linked to coro-
nary artery disease, but their significance is not known
yet. Contributing risk factors are:
• Obesity—Excess weight increases the strain on the
heart and increases the risk of developing coronary
artery disease even if no other risk factors are present.
Obesity increases blood pressure and blood cholesterol
and can lead to diabetes.
• Stress and anger—Some scientists believe that stress
and anger can contribute to the development of coro-
nary artery disease and increase the blood’s tendency to
form clots (thrombosis). Stress, the mental and physical
reaction to life’s irritations and challenges, increases
the heart rate and blood pressure and can injure the lin-
ing of the arteries. Evidence shows that anger increases
the risk of dying from heart disease. The risk of heart
attack is more than double after an episode of anger.
Chest pain (angina) is the main symptom of coro-
nary heart disease but it is not always present. Other
symptoms include shortness of breath, chest heaviness,
tightness, pain, a burning sensation, squeezing, or pres-
sure either behind the breastbone or in the arms, neck, or
jaws. Many people have no symptoms of coronary artery
disease before having a heart attack; 63% of women and
48% of men who died suddenly of coronary artery dis-
ease had no previous symptoms of the disease, according
to the American Heart Association.

Ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of preg-
nancy-related deaths in the first trimester and account for
9% of all pregnancy-related deaths in the United States.
More than 1% of pregnancies are ectopic, and they are
becoming more common. The reason for this increase is
not clearly understood, though it is thought that the dra-
matic increase in sexually transmitted diseases (STD)
is at least partly responsible.
The earlier an ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed and
treated, the better the outcome. The chances of having a
successful pregnancy are lower after an ectopic pregnan-
cy, but depend on the extent of permanent fallopian tube
damage. If the tube has been spared, chances are as high
as 60%. The chances of a successful pregnancy after the
removal of one tube are 40%.

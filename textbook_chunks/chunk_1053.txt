The exact cause of canker sores is uncertain, howev-
er, they seem to be related to a localized immune reac-
tion. Other proposed causes for this disease are trauma to
the affected areas from toothbrush scrapes, stress, hor-
mones, and food allergies. Canker sores tend to appear
in response to stress. The initial symptom is a tingling or
mildly painful itching sensation in the area where the
sore will appear. After one to several days, a small red
swelling appears. The sore is round, and is a whitish
color with a grayish colored center. Usually, there is a red
ring of inflammation surrounding the sore. The main
symptom is pain. Canker sores can be very painful, espe-
cially if they are touched repeatedly, e.g., by the tongue.
They last for one to two weeks.

Endoscopic sphincterotomy or endoscopic retrograde
sphincterotomy (ERS) is a relatively new endoscopic
technique developed to examine and treat abnormalities
of the bile ducts, pancreas and gallbladder. The procedure
was developed as an extension to the diagnostic examina-
tion, ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-
atography); with the addition of “sphincterotomy,”
abnormalities found during the study could be treated at
the same time without the need for invasive surgery.
The term ERS has three parts to its definition;
• endoscopic refers to the use of an endoscope
• retrograde refers to the insertion of the endoscope up
into the ducts in a direction opposite to or against the
normal flow of bile down the ducts
• sphincterotomy, which means cutting of the sphincter
or muscle that lies at the juncture of the intestine with
both the bile and pancreatic ducts

A diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed if there are
symptoms of diabetes and a plasma glucose level of at
least 11.1 mmol/L, a fasting plasma glucose level of at
least 7 mmol/L; or a two-hour plasma glucose level of at
least 11.1 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test.
Home blood glucose monitoring kits are available so
patients with diabetes can monitor their own levels. A
small needle or lancet is used to prick the finger and a
drop of blood is collected and analyzed by a monitoring
device. Some patients may test their blood glucose levels
several times during a day and use this information to
adjust their doses of insulin.

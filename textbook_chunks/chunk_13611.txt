Normal FSH test results vary according to age and
sexual maturity. The phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle
or use of birth-control pills also affects test results.
For an adult male, normal results range from about
4–25 units of FSH in every liter of blood (U/L) or about
5–20 micro-international units in every milliliter.
For a premenopausal woman, normal values range
from 4–30 U/L or 5–20 micro-international units per milli-
liter. In a pregnant woman, FSH levels are too low to mea-
sure. After menopause, normal values range from 40–250
U/L or 50–100 micro-international units per milliliter.
FSH levels fluctuate during premenopause. If no
other symptoms are present, an elevated FSH level should
not be interpreted as proof that menopause has begun.

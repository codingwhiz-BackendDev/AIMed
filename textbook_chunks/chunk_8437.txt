Swallowing problems usually call for esopha-
gograms. In the x ray department, the patient is given a
contrast agent to drink. During swallowing, x rays record
the passage of the agent down the esophagus and into the
stomach. Instead of a straight tube with well-coordinated
waves of contraction, the resulting x rays show a
writhing organ resembling a giant corkscrew.
Another test that is used in many disorders of
esophageal motility is manometry. Pressures inside the
esophagus are measured every inch or so using a balloon
device that is passed all the way down to the stomach.
The result is a precise record of its activity that yields a
specific diagnosis.

Several studies have shown that there is a well-
established link between asbestos and cancer. Chlorina-
tion of water may account for a small rise in cancer risk.
However, the main danger from pollution occurs when
dangerous chemicals from the industries escape into the
surrounding environment. It has been estimated that 1%
of cancer deaths are due to air, land and water pollution.
Cancer is a progressive disease, and goes through sev-
eral stages. Each stage may produce a number of symp-
toms. Some symptoms are produced early and may occur
due to a tumor that is growing within an organ or a gland.
As the tumor grows, it may press on the nearby nerves,
organs and blood vessels. This causes pain and some pres-
sure which may be the earliest warning signs of cancer.
Despite the fact that there are several hundred differ-
ent types of cancers, producing very different symptoms,
the ACS has established the following seven symptoms
as possible warning signals of cancer:
• changes in the size, color, or shape of a wart or a mole
• a sore that does not heal
• persistent cough, hoarseness, or sore throat
• a lump or thickening in the breast or elsewhere
• unusual bleeding or discharge
• chronic indigestion or difficulty in swallowing
• any change in bowel or bladder habits
Many other diseases, besides cancer, could produce
the same symptoms. However, it is important to have
these symptoms checked, as soon as possible, especially
if they linger. The earlier a cancer is diagnosed and treat-
ed, the better the chance of it being cured. Many cancers
such as breast cancer may not have any early symptoms.
Therefore, it is important to undergo routine screening
tests such as breast self-exams and mammograms.

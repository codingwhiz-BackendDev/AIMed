If a person is feeling faint, unconsciousness may be pre-
vented by sitting with the head between the knees, as
shown in the illustration above, or by lying flat with the legs
raised. Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
Bystanders should check the patient’s breathing and
pulse rate. The pulse may be weak and slow. If there are
no signs of breathing or heart rate, the problem is more
serious than fainting, and cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion (CPR) must begin.
If breathing and pulse rates seem normal, the person’s
legs should be raised above the level of the head so that
gravity can help the blood flow to the brain. Belts, collars
or any other constrictive clothing should be loosened.
If the person does not regain consciousness within a
minute or two after fainting, medical help should be
summoned.

Diagnosis of CTCL is often difficult in the early
stages because of its slow progression and ability to
mimic many other benign skin conditions. The early
patches of CTCL resemble eczema, psoriasis, and con-
tact dermatitis. In a further complication, the early man-
ifestations of the disease can respond favorably to the
topical corticosteroid treatments prescribed for these skin
disorders. This has the unfortunate result of the disease
being missed and the patient remaining untreated for
years. CTCL is most likely discovered when a physician
maintains a suspicion about the disease, performs multi-
ple skin biopsies, and provides close follow-up after the
initial presentation.
Skin biopsies showing penetration of abnormal cells
into the epidermal tissue are necessary to make a firm
diagnosis of CTCL. Several molecular studies can also
help support the diagnosis. The first looks at the cellular
proteins seen on the surface of the abnormal cells. Many
cases of CTCL show the retention of the CD4+ protein,
but the loss of other proteins usually seen on the surface
of mature CD4+ cells, such as Leu-8 or Leu-9. The
abnormal cells also show unusual rearrangements at the
genetic level for the gene that encodes the T-cell recep-
tors. These rearrangements can be identified using
Southern blot analysis. The information from the molec-
ular tests, combined with the presence of abnormal cells
in the epidermis, strongly supports the CTCL diagnosis.

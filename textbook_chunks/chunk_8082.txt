Patients with Type I diabetes need daily injections of
insulin to help their bodies use glucose. The amount and
type of insulin required depends on the height, weight,
age, food intake, and activity level of the individual dia-
betic patient. Some patients with Type II diabetes may
need to use insulin injections if their diabetes cannot be
controlled with diet, exercise, and oral medication. Injec-
tions are given subcutaneously, that is, just under the
skin, using a small needle and syringe. Injection sites can
be anywhere on the body where there is looser skin,
including the upper arm, abdomen, or upper thigh.
Purified human insulin is most commonly used,
however, insulin from beef and pork sources are also
available. Insulin may be given as an injection of a single
dose of one type of insulin once a day. Different types of
insulin can be mixed and given in one dose or split into
two or more doses during a day. Patients who require
multiple injections over the course of a day may be able
to use an insulin pump that administers small doses of
insulin on demand. The small battery-operated pump is
worn outside the body and is connected to a needle that is
inserted into the abdomen. Pumps can be programmed to
inject small doses of insulin at various times during the
day, or the patient may be able to adjust the insulin doses
to coincide with meals and exercise.

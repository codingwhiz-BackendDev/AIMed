Children take their first significant steps toward
socialization and peer interaction when they begin to
engage in cooperative play at around age four. Their
social development will progress throughout childhood
and adolescence as they develop friendships, start to be
influenced by their peers, and begin to show interest in
the opposite sex.
Factors which can have a negative impact on the
emotional and social well-being of children include:
• Violence. Bullying can cause serious damage to a
child’s sense of self-esteem and personal safety, as can
experiences with school violence.
• Family turmoil. Divorce, death, and other life-chang-
ing events that alter the family dynamic can have a seri-
ous impact on a child. Even a positive event such as the
birth of a sibling or a move to a new city and school can
put emotional strain on a child.
• Stress. The pressure to perform well academically and
in extracurricular activities such as sports can be over-
whelming to some children.
• Peer pressure. Although it can have a positive impact,
peer pressure is often a source of significant stress for
children. This is particularly true in adolescence when
“fitting in” seems all-important.
• Drugs and alcohol. Curiosity is intrinsic to childhood,
and over 30% of children have experimented with alco-
hol by age 13. Open communication with children that
sets forth parental expectations about drug and alcohol
use is essential.
• Negative sexual experiences. Sexual abuse and assault
can emotionally scar a child and instill negative feel-
ings about sexuality and relationships.

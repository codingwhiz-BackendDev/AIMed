When bleeding cannot be controlled by hormone
treatment, surgery may be necessary. Dilation and curet-
tage sometimes relieves the symptoms of DUB. If that
fails, endometrial ablation removes the uterine lining, but
preserves a womanâ€™s uterus. This procedure is sometimes
be used instead of hysterectomy. However, as it affects
the uterus, it can only be used when a woman has com-
pleted her childbearing years. The prescription of iron is
also important to decrease the risk of enemia.
Until the 1980s, hysterectomy often was used to
treat heavy uterine bleeding. Today hysterectomy is used
less frequently to treat DUB, and then only after other
methods of controlling the symptoms have failed. A hys-
terectomy leaves a woman unable to bear children, and,
therefore, is limited largely to women who are unable to,
or uninterested in, bearing children. Still, hysterectomy
is a common treatment for long-standing DUB in women
done with childbearing.

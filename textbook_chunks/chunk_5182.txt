Unless corrected soon after birth, abnormal stresses
cause malformation of the developing femur, with a char-
acteristic limp or waddling gait. If cases of congenital
hip dysplasia go untreated, the child will have difficulty
walking, which could result in life-long pain. In addition,
if this condition goes untreated, the abnormal hip posi-
tioning will force the acetabulum to locate to another
position to accommodate the displaced femur.

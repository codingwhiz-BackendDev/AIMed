of cycle breast sensitivity and engorge-
ment may also be treated with diet, medication, and/or
physical modifications. For example,
• Although there is no scientific data to support this
claim, many women have reported relief of symptoms
when caffeine was reduced or eliminated from their
diets. Decreasing salt before and during the period
when breasts are most sensitive may also ease swelling
and discomfort. Low-fat diets and elimination of dairy
products also appear to decrease soreness for some
women. However, it may take several months to realize
the effects of these various treatments.
• Over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen
(Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) may be recommended.
In some cases, treatment with prescription drugs such
as hormones or hormone blockers may prove success-
ful. Oral contraceptives may also be prescribed.
• Warm soaks or ice packs may provide comfort. A well-
fitted support bra can minimize physical movement and
do much to relieve breast discomfort. Breast massage
may promote removal of excess fluid from tissues and
alleviate symptoms. Massaging the breast with castor
oil, straight or infused with herbs or essential oils, can
help reduce and dissipate fibroadenomas as well as keep
women in touch with changes in their breast tissue.
• Infections are often treated with warm compresses and
antibiotics. Lactating women are encouraged to contin-
ue breastfeeding because it promotes drainage and
healing. However, a serious infection may progress to
form an abscess that may need surgical drainage.
• Some studies of alternative or complementary treat-
ments, although controversial, have indicated that vita-
mins A, B complex and E, and mineral supplements
may reduce the risk of developing fibrocystic condition
of the breast. Evening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis),
flaxseed oil, and fish oils have been reported to be effec-
tive in relieving cyclic breast pain for some women.

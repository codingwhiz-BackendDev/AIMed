Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a
special procedure that uses an artificial heart-lung
machine to take over the work of the lungs (and some-
times also the heart). ECMO is used most often in new-
borns and young children, but it also can be used as a last
resort for adults whose heart or lungs are failing.

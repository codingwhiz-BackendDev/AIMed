Patients with other medical conditions should consult
with their primary physician before undergoing face lift
surgery. Lung problems, heart disease, and certain other
conditions can lead to a higher risk of complications.
Patients who take medications that can alter the way their
blood clots (including female hormones, aspirin, and
some non-aspirin pain relievers) should stop these med-
ications prior to surgery to lower the risk that a hematoma
will form. A hematoma, a pocket of blood below the skin,
is the most frequent complication of face lift surgery.

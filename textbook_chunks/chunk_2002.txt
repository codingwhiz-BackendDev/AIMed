Cerebral palsy cannot be cured, but many of the dis-
abilities it causes can be managed through planning and
timely care. Treatment for a child with CP depends on the
severity, nature, and location of the primary muscular symp-
toms, as well as any associated problems that might be pre-
sent. Optimal care of a child with mild CP may involve reg-
ular interaction with only a physical therapist and occupa-
tional therapist, whereas care for a more severely affected
child may include visits to multiple medical specialists
throughout life. With proper treatment and an effective plan,
most people with CP can lead productive, happy lives.

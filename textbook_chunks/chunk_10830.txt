already present in the stomach and intestines, or they
may be transmitted by contaminated food and water. It is
also possible for enterobacterial infections to spread by
person-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is
12–72 hours.
ESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections
cause most of the enterobacterial infections in the United
States. The organisms are categorized according to
whether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive
types of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic
E. coli, or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli, or ETEC.
EPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin)
in the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices and
causes the patient to lose large amounts of water through
the intestines.
The invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor-
rhagic E. coli, or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or
EIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct-
ly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHEC
can produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic
syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by
the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure.
EHEC has become a growing problem in the United
States because of outbreaks caused by contaminated
food. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 has
been identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers,
unpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2–7% of
infections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS.

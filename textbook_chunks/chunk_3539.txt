CMP is the result of the normal aging process,
overuse, injury, or uneven pressures exerted on the knee
joint. In teens, CMP may be caused by uneven growth or
uneven strength in the thigh muscles. Growth spurts,
common in teens, may result in a mildly abnormal align-
ment of the patella, which increases the angle formed by
the thigh and the patellar tendon (Q-angle). This condi-
tion adds to the damage. Symptoms include pain, nor-
mally around the kneecap, and a grinding sensation felt
when extending the leg. The pain may radiate to the back
of the knee, or it may be intermittent and brought on by
squatting, kneeling, going up or down stairs, especially
down, or by repeated bending of the joint.

Standing and walking correctly can sometimes elim-
inate excess foot pressure. Several types of bodywork
can help correct body imbalances. Bodywork is a term
used for any of a number of systems, including Aston-
Patterning, the Feldenkrais method, and rolfing, that
manipulate the body through massage, movement educa-
tion, or meditational techniques.
Aloe (Aloe barbadensis) cream is an effective skin
softener, and two or three daily applications of calendu-
la (Calendula officinalis) salve can soften skin and pre-
vent inflammation. One teaspoon of lemon juice mixed
with one teaspoon of dried chamomile (Martricaria
recutita) tea and one crushed garlic clove dissolves
thickened skin.
An ayurvedic practitioner may recommend the fol-
lowing treatment:
• apply each day a paste made by combining one tea-
spoon of aloe vera gel with half that amount of turmeric
(Circuma longa)
• bandage overnight
• soak in warm water for 10 minutes every morning
• massage gently with mustard (Brassica cruciferae) oil

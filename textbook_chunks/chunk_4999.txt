There are two sub-types of CD, one beginning in
childhood and the other in adolescence. There is no
known cause. Researchers and physicians suggest that
this disease may be caused by the following:
• poor parent-child relationships
• dysfunctional families
• drug abuse
• physical abuse
• poor relationships with other children
• cognitive problems leading to school failures
• brain damage
• biological defects
Difficulty in school is an early sign of potential con-
duct disorder problems. While the patient’s IQ tends to
be in the normal range, they can have trouble with verbal
and abstract reasoning skills and may lag behind their
classmates, and consequently, feel as if they don’t “fit
in.” The frustration and loss of self-esteem resulting from
this academic and social inadequacy can trigger the
development of CD.
A dysfunctional home environment can be another
major contributor to CD. An emotionally, physically, or
sexually abusive home environment, a family history of
antisocial personality disorder, or parental substance
abuse can damage a child’s perceptions of himself and
put him on a path toward negative behavior. Other less
obvious environmental factors can also play a part in the
development of conduct disorder. Long-term studies
have shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy
may be linked to the development of CD in boys. Ani-
mal and human studies point out that nicotine can have
undesirable effects on babies. These include altered
structure and function of their nervous systems, learning
deficits, and behavioral problems. In a study of 177 boys
ages seven-12 years, those with mothers who smoked
over one half a package of cigarettes daily while preg-
nant were more apt to have a CD than those with moth-
ers who did not smoke.
Other conditions that may cause or co-exist with CD
include head injury, substance abuse disorder, major
depressive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). Thirty to fifty percent of children
diagnosed with ADHD, a disorder characterized by a
persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity, also
have CD.
CD is defined as a repetitive behavioral pattern of
violating the rights of others or societal norms. Three of
the following criteria, or symptoms, are required over the
previous 12 months for a diagnosis of CD (one of the
three must have occurred in the past six months):
• bullies, threatens, or intimidates others
• picks fights
• has used a dangerous weapon
• has been physically cruel to people
• has been physically cruel to animals
• has stolen while confronting a victim (for example,
mugging or extortion)
• has forced someone into sexual activity
• has deliberately set a fire with the intention of causing
damage
• has deliberately destroyed property of others
• has broken into someone else’s house or car
• frequently lies to get something or to avoid obligations
• has stolen without confronting a victim or breaking and
entering (e.g., shoplifting or forgery)
• stays out at night; breaks curfew (beginning before 13
years of age)
• has run away from home overnight at least twice (or
once for a lengthy period)
• is often truant from school (beginning before 13 years
of age).

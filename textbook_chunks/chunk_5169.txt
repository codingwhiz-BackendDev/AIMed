Clinical studies show a familial tendency toward hip
dysplasia, with more females affected than males. This
disorder is found in many cultures around the world.
However, statistics show that the Native American popu-
lation has a high incidence of hip dislocation. This has
been documented to be due to the common practice of
swaddling and using cradleboards for restraining the
infants. This places the infantâ€™s hips into extreme adduc-
tion (brought together). The incidence of congenital hip
dysplasia is also higher in infants born by caesarian and
breech position births. Evidence also shows a greater
chance of this hip abnormality in the first born compared
to the second or third child. Hormonal changes within the
mother during pregnancy, resulting in increased ligament
laxity, is thought to possibly cross over to the placenta
and cause the baby to have lax ligaments while still in the
womb. Other symptoms of complete dislocation include a
shortening of the leg and limited ability to abduct the leg.

The purpose of chest physical therapy, also called
chest physiotherapy, is to help patients breathe more
freely and to get more oxygen into the body. Chest physi-
cal therapy includes postural drainage, chest percussion,
chest vibration, turning, deep breathing exercises, and
coughing. It is usually done in conjunction with other
treatments to rid the airways of secretions. These other
treatments include suctioning, nebulizer treatments, and
the administration of expectorant drugs.
Chest physical therapy can be used with newborns,
infants, children, and adults. People who benefit from
chest physical therapy exhibit a wide range of problems
that make it difficult to clear secretions from their lungs.
Some people who may receive chest physical therapy
include people with cystic fibrosis or neuromuscular dis-
eases like Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, progressive mus-
cle weakness (myasthenia gravis), or tetanus. People
with lung diseases such as bronchitis, pneumonia, or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) also ben-
efit from chest physical therapy. People who are likely to
aspirate their mucous secretions because of diseases such
as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy also receive
chest physical therapy, as do some people who are
bedridden, confined to a wheelchair, or who cannot
breathe deeply because of postoperative pain.

Kidney failure patients with hypertension typically
take medication to control their high blood pressure.
Epoetin alfa, or EPO (Epogen), a hormone therapy, and
intravenous or oral iron supplements are used to manage
anemia. A multivitamin may be prescribed to replace vit-
amins lost during dialysis treatments. Vitamin D, which
promotes the absorption of calcium, along with calcium
supplements, may also be prescribed.
Since 1973, Medicare has picked up 80% of ESRD
treatment costs, including the costs of dialysis and trans-
plantation and of some medications. To qualify for bene-
fits, a patient must be insured or eligible for benefits
under Social Security, or be a spouse or child of an eligi-
ble American. Private insurance and state Medicaid pro-
grams often cover the remaining 20% of treatment costs.

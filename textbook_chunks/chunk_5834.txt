Coronary artery bypass graft surgery builds a detour
around one or more blocked coronary arteries with a
graft from a healthy vein or artery. The graft goes around
the clogged artery (or arteries) to create new pathways
for oxygen-rich blood to flow to the heart.
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is major surgery
performed in a hospital. The length of the procedure
depends upon the number of arteries being bypassed, but it
generally  takes from four to six hoursâ€”sometimes longer.
The average hospital stay is four to seven days. Full recov-
ery from coronary artery bypass graft surgery takes three to
four months. Within four to six weeks, people with seden-
tary office jobs can return to work; people with physical
jobs must wait longer and sometimes change careers.
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is widely per-
formed in the United States. The American Heart Associ-
ation estimates that 573,000 coronary artery bypass graft
surgeries were performed on 363,000 patients in 1995.
Seventy-four percent of these procedures were per-
formed on men and 44% on men and women under the
age of 65 (1995 data). The estimated average cost of this
procedure in 1995 was $44,820.

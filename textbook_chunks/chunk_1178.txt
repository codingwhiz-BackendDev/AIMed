The left ventricle is the main pump for distributing
blood through the body. A cardiac blood pool scan is
used to determine how efficiently the left ventricle is
working. The scan can detect aneurysms of the left ven-
tricle, motion abnormalities caused by damage to the
heart wall, cardiac shunts between the left and right ven-
tricle, and coronary occlusive artery disease.

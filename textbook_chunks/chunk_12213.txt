Munchausen by proxy is the name given to facti-
tious disorders in children produced by parents or
other caregivers. The parent may falsify the child’s
medical history or tamper with laboratory tests in
order to make the child appear sick. Occasionally, they
may actually injure the child to assure that the child
will be treated.
Ganser’s syndrome
Ganser’s syndrome is an unusual dissociative reac-
tion to extreme stress in which the patient gives absurd
or silly answers to simple questions. It has sometimes
been labeled as psychiatric malingering, but is more
often classified as a factitious disorder.

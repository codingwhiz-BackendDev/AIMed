Chagas’ disease is named after Dr. Carlos Chagas
who first found the organism in the early 1900s. It
involves damage to the nerves that control the heart,
digestive and other organs, and eventually leads to dam-
age to these organs. Worldwide, Chagas’ disease affects
over 15 million persons, and kills 50,000 each year.
Researchers believe that the parasite that causes the dis-
ease is only found in the Americas.

FOBT uses chemical indicators on stool samples to
detect the presence of blood not otherwise visible. (The
word “occult” in the test’s name means that the blood is
hidden from view.) Blood originating from or passing
through the gastrointestinal tract can signal many condi-
tions requiring further diagnostic procedures and, possi-
bly, medical intervention. These conditions may be
benign or malignant and some of them include:
• colorectal and gastric cancers
• ulcers
• hemorrhoids
• polyps
• inflammatory bowel disease
• irritations or lesions of the gastrointestinal tract caused
by medications (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs, also called NSAIDs)
• irritations or lesions of the gastrointestinal tract caused
by stomach acid disorders, such as reflux esophagitis
The FOBT is used routinely (in conjunction with a
rectal examination performed by a physician) to screen
for colorectal cancer, particularly after age 50. The order-
ing of this test should not be taken as an indication that
cancer is suspected. The FOBT must be combined with
regular screening endoscopy (such as a sigmoidoscopy)
to detect cancers at an early stage.

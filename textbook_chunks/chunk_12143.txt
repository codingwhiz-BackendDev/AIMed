A close-up of the eye of an elderly patient showing ectropi-
on of the lower eyelid. Ectropion is a condition in which the
eyelid turns away from the eye.The most common type is
senile ectropion (seen here), in which the droop of the eye-
lid is due to loss of tissue elasticity in old age and weak-
ness in the muscles surrounding the eye. (Photograph by Dr.

All of these eyelid disorders, if not treated, can lead
to other, possibly serious vision problemsâ€”dry eye,
astigmatism, or even vision loss, for example. An oph-
thalmologist or optometrist should be consulted.

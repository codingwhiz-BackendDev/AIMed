True clubfoot is characterized by abnormal bone for-
mation in the foot. There are four variations of clubfoot,
including talipes varus, talipes valgus, talipes equines,
and talipes calcaneus. In talipes varus, the most common
form of clubfoot, the foot generally turns inward so that
the leg and foot look somewhat like the letter J. In talipes
valgus, the foot rotates outward like the letter L. In tal-
ipes equinus, the foot points downward, similar to that of
a toe dancer. In talipes calcaneus, the foot points upward,
with the heel pointing down.
Clubfoot can affect one foot or both. Sometimes an
infantâ€™s feet appear abnormal at birth because of the
intrauterine position of the fetus birth. If there is no
anatomic abnormality of the bone, this is not true club-
foot, and the problem can usually be corrected by apply-
ing special braces or casts to straighten the foot.
The ratio of males to females with clubfoot is 2.5 to
1. The incidence of clubfoot varies only slightly. In the
United States, the incidence is approximately 1 in every
1,000 live births. A 1980 Danish study reported an over-
all incidence of 1.20 in every 1,000 children; by 1994,
that number had doubled to 2.41 in every 1,000 live
births. No reason was offered for the increase.

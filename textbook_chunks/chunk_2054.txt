For most people, the most common side effect after
the removal of CSF is a headache. This occurs in
10–30% of adult patients and in up to 40% of children. It
is caused by a decreased CSF pressure related to a small
leak of CSF through the puncture site. These headaches
usually are a dull pain, although some people report a
throbbing sensation. A stiff neck and nausea may accom-
pany the headache. Lumbar puncture headaches typically
begin within two days after the procedure and persist
from a few days to several weeks or months.
Since an upright position worsens the pain, patients
with a lumbar puncture headache can control the pain by
lying in a flat position and taking a prescription or non-
prescription pain relief medication, preferably one con-
taining caffeine. In rare cases, the puncture site leak is
“patched” using the patient’s own blood.
People should talk to their doctor about complica-
tions from a lumbar puncture. In most cases, this test to
analyze CSF is a safe and effective procedure. Some
patients experience pain, difficulty urinating, infection,
or leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the puncture site
after the procedure.

Abnormal findings on chest x rays are used in con-
junction with a physicianâ€™s physical exam findings,
patient medical history and other diagnostic tests to reach
a final diagnosis. For many diseases, chest x rays are
more effective when compared to previous chest studies.
The patient is asked to help the radiology facility in
locating previous chest radiographs from other facilities.

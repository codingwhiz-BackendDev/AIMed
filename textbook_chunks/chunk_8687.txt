Immediately after the dislocation, the application of
ice is helpful to control swelling and decrease pain. If the
patient needs to be transported, it is important to prevent
the joint from moving (immobilization). At times, a cast
or splint may be used to immobilize the joint and ensure
proper alignment and healing. The treatment of realign-
ing bones following a dislocation is called reduction.
This may include simple maneuvers that manipulate the
joint to reposition the bones or surgical procedures to
restore the joint to its normal position. A general anesthe-
sia or muscle relaxant may be used to help make joint
reduction possible by relaxing surrounding muscles in
spasm. Acetaminophen or aspirin are sometimes used
to control moderate pain, and narcotics may be pre-
scribed by the physician if the pain is severe. Recurring
dislocation may require surgical reconstruction or
replacement of the joint. It is not recommended to
attempt to reset a dislocated joint outside of a medical

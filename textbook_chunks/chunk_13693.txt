less by heat. Finally, botulism is much more likely to be
fatal even in tiny quantities.
Adult botulism outbreaks are usually associated
with home canned food, although occasionally commer-
cially canned or vacuum packed foods are responsible
for the disease. C. botulinum grows well in non-acidic,
oxygen-free environments. If food is canned at too low
heat or for too brief a time, the bacteria is not killed. It
reproduces inside the can or jar, releasing its deadly neu-
rotoxin. The toxin can be made harmless by heating the
contaminated food to boiling for ten minutes. However,
even a very small amount of the C. botulinum toxin can
cause serious illness or death.

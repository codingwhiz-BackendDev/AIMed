INITIAL OBSERVATIONS AND SLIT LAMP EXAM.
Some general observations the doctor may be looking for
include: head tilt; drooping eyelids (ptosis); eye turns;
red eyes (injection); eye movement; size, shape, and
color of the iris; clarity of the cornea, anterior chamber,
and lens. The anterior chamber lies behind the cornea
and in front of the iris. If it appears cloudy or if cells can
be seen in it during the slit lamp exam an inflammation
may be present. A narrow anterior chamber may put the
patient at risk for glaucoma. A clouding of the normally
clear lens is called a cataract.

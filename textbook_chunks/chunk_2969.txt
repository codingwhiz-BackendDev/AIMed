bruises to the baby’s face. When used by an experienced
physician, forceps can save the life of a baby in distress.
Vacuum-assisted birth
This method of helping a baby out of the birth canal
was developed as a gentler alternative to forceps. Vacu-
um-assisted birth can only be used after the cervix is
fully dilated (expanded), and the head of the fetus has
begun to descend through the pelvis. In this procedure,
the doctor uses a device called a vacuum extractor, plac-
ing a large rubber or plastic cup against the baby’s head.
A pump creates suction that gently pulls on the cup to
ease the baby down the birth canal. The force of the suc-
tion may cause a bruise on the baby’s head, but it fades
away in a day or so.
The vacuum extractor is not as likely as forceps to
injure the mother, and it leaves more room for the baby
to pass through the pelvis. However, there may be prob-
lems in maintaining the suction during the vacuum-
assisted birth, so forceps may be a better choice if it is
important to remove the baby quickly.

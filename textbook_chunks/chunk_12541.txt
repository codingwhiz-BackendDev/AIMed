Conventional medicine recommends the dietary and
lifestyle changes outlined above as a first line of defense
against fatigue. Individuals who experience occasional
fatigue symptoms may benefit from short term use of
caffeine-containing central nervous stimulants, which
make people more alert, less drowsy, and improve coor-
dination. However, these should be prescribed with
extreme caution, as overuse of the drug can lead to seri-
ous sleep disorders, like insomnia.
Another reason to avoid extended use of caffeine is
its associated withdrawal symptoms. People who use
large amounts of caffeine over long periods build up a
tolerance to it. When that happens, they have to use more
and more caffeine to get the same effects. Heavy caffeine
use can also lead to dependence. If an individual stops
using caffeine abruptly, withdrawal symptoms may
occur, including headache, fatigue, drowsiness, yawn-
ing, irritability, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose.
These symptoms can go on for as long as a week.

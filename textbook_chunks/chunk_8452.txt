The prevalence of DiGeorge syndrome is debated;
the estimates range from 1:4000 to 1:6395. Because
the symptoms caused by the chromosomal abnormality
vary somewhat from patient to patient, the syndrome
probably occurs much more often than was previously
thought. DiGeorge syndrome is sometimes described
as one of the “CATCH 22” disorders, so named
because of their characteristics—cardiac defects,
abnormal facial features, thymus underdevelopment,
cleft palate, and hypocalcemia—caused by a deletion
of several genes in chromosome 22. The specific facial
features associated with DiGeorge syndrome include
low-set ears, wide-set eyes, a small jaw, and a short
groove in the upper lip. The male/female ratio is 1:1.
The syndrome appears to be equally common in all
racial and ethnic groups.

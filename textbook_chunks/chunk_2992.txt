Regional anesthetics include epidurals and spinals.
In this technique, medication is injected into the space
around the spinal nerves. Depending on the type of med-
ications used, this type of anesthesia can block nerve sig-
nals, causing temporary pain relief, or a loss of sensation
from the waist down. An epidural or spinal block can
provide complete pain relief during cesarean birth.
An epidural is placed with the woman lying on her
side or sitting up in bed with the back rounded to allow
more space between the vertebrae. Her back is scrubbed
with antiseptic, and a local anesthetic is injected in the
skin to numb the site. The needle is inserted between two
vertebrae and through the tough tissue in front of the
spinal column. A catheter is put in place that allows con-
tinuous doses of anesthetic to be given.
This type of anesthesia provides complete pain
relief, and can help conserve a woman’s energy, since she
can relax or even sleep during labor. This type of anes-
thesia does require an IV and fetal monitor. It may be
harder for a woman to bear down when it comes time to
push, although the amount of anesthesia can be adjusted
as this stage nears.
Spinal anesthesia operates on the same principle as
epidural anesthesia, and is used primarily in cases of c-
section delivery. It is administered in the same way as an
epidural, but the catheter is not left in place. The amount
of anesthetic injected is large, since it must be injected at
one time. Because of the anesthetic’s effect on motor
nerves, most women using it cannot push during delivery.

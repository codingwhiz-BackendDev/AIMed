Cervical disk disease is a gradual process that occurs
with aging, though poor posture, repeated lifting, and
tobacco use can hasten its course. Symptoms include
pain when moving the neck and limited neck movement.
The condition can also affect the hand, shoulder, and arm
resulting in pain, numbness/tingling, and weakness. If
the spinal cord itself is affected, these symptoms may
occur in the legs. Loss of bowel or bladder control may
also occur.

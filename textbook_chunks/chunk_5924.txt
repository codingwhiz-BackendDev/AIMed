High blood pressure, one of the most common and
serious risk factors for coronary artery disease, can be
completely controlled through lifestyle changes and
medication. Moderate hypertension can be controlled by
reducing dietary intake of sodium and fat, exercising reg-
ularly, managing stress, abstaining from smoking, and
drinking alcohol in moderation. People for whom these
changes do not work or people with severe hypertension
may be helped by many categories of medication.

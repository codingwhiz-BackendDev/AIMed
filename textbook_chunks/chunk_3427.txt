A study released in 1999 indicated that blue-green
algae contains polyunsaturated fatty acids that lower
cholesterol. The algae, known as alga Aphanizomenon
flos-aquae (AFA) is available as an over-the-counter
dietary supplement. Niacin, also known as nicotinic acid
or vitamin B3, has been shown to reduce LDL levels by
10–20%, and raise HDL levels by 15–35%. It also can
reduce triglycerides. But because an extremely high dose
of niacin (2–3 g) is needed to treat cholesterol problems,
it should only be taken under a doctor’s supervision to
monitor possible toxic side effects. Niacin can also cause
flushing when taken in high doses. Soy protein with high
levels of isoflavones also have been shown to reduce bad
cholesterol by up to 10%. A daily diet that contains 62
mg of isoflavones in soy protein is recommended, and
can be incorporated into other diet regimens, including
vegetarian, Asian, and low glycemic.

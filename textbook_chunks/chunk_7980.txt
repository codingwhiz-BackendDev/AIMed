It is easy to see that a septum is deviated. It is more
difficult to determine if that deviation needs correction. It
is common for a patient to complain that he/she can
breathe through only one nostril. Then the diagnosis is
easy. A deviated septum may also contribute to snoring,
sleep apnea, and other breathing disorders.

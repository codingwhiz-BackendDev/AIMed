The duodenum is the first part of the intestine, into
which the stomach, the gall bladder, and the pancreas
empty their contents. The pylorus connects the duode-
num with the stomach and contains the valve that regu-
lates stomach emptying. Obstruction usually occurs right
at this outlet, so that the gall bladder and pancreas are
unable to drain their secretions without hindrance.

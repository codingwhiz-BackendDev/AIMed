Conjunctivitis caused by gonococcal and chlamydial
infection usually requires conventional medical treat-
ment. With bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis,
however, alternative options can be helpful. Internal
immune enhancement with supplementation can aid in
the resolution of bacterial and viral conjunctivitis.
Removal of the allergic agent is an essential step in treat-
ing allergic conjunctivitis. As with any of the recom-
mended treatments, however, if no improvement is seen
within 48–72 hours, a physician should be consulted.
Homeopathically, there are a number of acute reme-
dies designed to treat conjunctivitis. These include Pul-
satilla (windflower, Pulsatilla nigricans), Belladonna,
and eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis). Eye drops, pre-
pared with homeopathic remedies and/or herbs, can be a
good substitute for pharmaceutical eye drops. Eye washes
can also be made. Herbal eyewashes made with eyebright
(1 tsp. dried herb steeped in 1 pint of boiling water) or
chamomile (Matricaria recutita; 2–3 tsp in 1 pt of boiling
water) may be helpful. Eyewashes should be strained and
cooled before use, and close attention should be paid to
make sure that any solution put into the eye is sterile.
Other simple home remedies may help relieve the
discomfort associated with conjunctivitis. A boric acid
eyewash can be used to clean and soothe the eyes. A
warm compress applied to the eyes for five to 10 minutes
three times a day can help relieve the discomfort of bac-
terial and viral conjunctivitis. A cool compress or cool,
damp tea bags placed on the eyes can ease the discomfort
of allergic conjunctivitis.

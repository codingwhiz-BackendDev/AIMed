Breast fibroadenomas, abnormal growths of glandu-
lar and fibrous tissues, are most common between the
ages of 15 and 30, and are found in 10% of all women
(20% of African-American women). They are found
rarely in postmenopausal women.
Described as feeling like marbles, these firm, round,
movable, and “rubbery” lumps range from 1–5 cm in size.
Giant fibroadenomas are larger, lemon-sized lumps. Usually
single, from 10–15% of women have more than one.
While some types of breast lumps come and go dur-
ing the menstrual cycle, fibroadenomas typically do not
disappear after a woman’s period, and should be checked
by a doctor.

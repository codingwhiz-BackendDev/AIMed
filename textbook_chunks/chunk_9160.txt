Dry mouth, resulting from thickened or reduced
salvia flow, can be caused by a number of factors: med-
ications, both prescription and over-the-counter; sys-
temic diseases, such as anemia or diabetes, manifesta-
tions of Sjögren’s syndrome (as rheumatoid arthritis,
lupus, chronic hardening and thickening of the skin, or
chronic and progressive inflammation of sketal muscles);
infections of the salivary glands; blockage of the salivary
ducts caused by stones or tumors forming in the ducts
through which the saliva passes; dehydration; medical
therapies, such as local surgery or radiation; secretion
reduction normally involved in the aging proces; and
emotional stress.

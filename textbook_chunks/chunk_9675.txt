Dietary changes, in addition to cutting back the
amount of sodium eaten, may also help reduce edema.
Foods that worsen edema, such as alcohol, caffeine,
sugar, dairy products, soy sauce, animal protein, choco-
late, olives, and pickles, should be avoided. Diuretic herbs
can also help relieve edema. One of the best herbs for this
purpose is dandelion (Taraxacum mongolicum), since, in
addition to its diuretic action, it is a rich source of potassi-
um. (Diuretics flush potassium from the body and it must
be replaced to avoid potassium deficiency.) Hydrothera-
py using daily contrast applications of hot and cold
(either compresses or immersion) may also be helpful.

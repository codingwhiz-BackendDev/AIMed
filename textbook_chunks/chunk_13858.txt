Linear fractures have a break that runs parallel to the
bone’s main axis or in the direction of the bone’s shaft.
For example, a linear fracture of the arm bone could
extend the entire length of the bone. Oblique and trans-
verse fractures differ in that an oblique fracture crosses a
bone at approximately a 45° angle to the bone’s axis. In
contrast, a transverse fracture crosses a bone’s axis at a
90° angle. A longitudinal fracture is similar to a linear
fracture. Its fracture line extends along the shaft but is
more irregular in shape and does not run parallel to the
bone’s axis. Spiral fractures are described as crossing a
bone at an oblique angle, creating a spiral pattern. This
break usually occurs in the long bones of the body such as
the upper arm bone (humerus) or the thigh bone (femur).

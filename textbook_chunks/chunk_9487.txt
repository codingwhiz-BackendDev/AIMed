Echinacea, or purple coneflower, is a perennial herb
of the Composite family, commonly known as the daisy
family. Most often referred to as the purple coneflower,
this hardy plant also known as Sampson root, Missouri
snakeroot, and rudbeckia. The prominent, bristly seed
head inspired the generic name of the plant, taken from
the Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog.

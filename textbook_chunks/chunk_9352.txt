The treatment of dyspepsia is based on assessment
of symptoms and suspected causative factors. Clinical
evaluation is aimed at distinguishing those patients who
require immediate diagnostic work-ups from those who
can safely benefit from more conservative initial treat-
ment. Some of the latter may require only reassurance,
dietary modifications, or antacid use. Medications to
block production of stomach acids, prokinate agents, or
antibiotic treatment may be considered. Further diagnos-
tic investigation is indicated if there is severe abdominal
pain, pain radiating to the back, unexplained weight loss,
difficulty swallowing, a palpable mass, or anemia. Addi-
tional work-up is also indicated if a patient does not
respond to prescribed medications.

Diagnosis is based on pain upon palpation (gentle
pressing) of the affected joints. Swelling is not associated
with costochondritis. Diagnosis is also dependent on the
exclusion of other causes, including heart attack or bac-
terial or fungal infections found in IV drug users or post-
operative thoracic surgery patients.

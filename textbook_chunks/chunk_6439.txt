Botanical/herbal medicines can be helpful in healing
the cough that is commonly associated with croup. Sev-
eral herbs to consider for cough treatment include
aniseed (Pimpinella anisum), sundew (Drosera rotundi-
folia), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and wild cherry bark
(Prunus serotina). Homeopathic medicine can be very
effective in treating cases of croup. Choosing the correct
remedy (a common choice is aconite or monkshood,
Aconitum napellus) is always the key to the success of
this type of treatment.

Patients may seek therapy independently, or be
referred for treatment by a primary physician, psycholo-
gist, or psychiatrist. Because the patient and therapist
work closely together to achieve specific therapeutic
objectives, it is important that their working relationship
is comfortable and their goals are compatible. Prior to
beginning treatment, the patient and therapist should
meet for a consultation session, or mutual interview. The
consultation gives the therapist the opportunity to make
an initial assessment of the patient and recommend a
course of treatment and goals for therapy. It also gives
the patient an opportunity to find out important details
about the therapistâ€™s approach to treatment, professional
credentials, and any other issues of interest.
In some managed-care clinical settings, an intake
interview or evaluation is required before a patient
begins therapy. The intake interview is used to evaluate
the patient and assign him or her to a therapist. It may be
conducted by a psychiatric nurse, counselor, or social
worker.

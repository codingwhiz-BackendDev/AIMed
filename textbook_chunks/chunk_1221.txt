Prior to the cardiac catheterization procedure, it is
important to relay information to the physician or nurse
regarding allergies to shellfish (such as shrimp or scal-
lops) which contain iodine, iodine itself, or the dyes that
are commonly used in other diagnostic tests.
Because this procedure is categorized as a surgery, the
patient will be instructed not to eat or drink anything for at
least six hours prior to the test. Just before the test begins,
the patient will urinate and change into a hospital gown,
then lie flat on a padded table that may also be tilted in
order for the heart to be examined from a variety of angles.

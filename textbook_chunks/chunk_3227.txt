A cholecystectomy is performed to treat cholelithia-
sis and cholecystitis. In cholelithiasis, gallstones of
varying shapes and sizes form from the solid components
of bile. The presence of stones, often referred to as gall-
bladder disease, may produce symptoms of excruciating
right upper abdominal pain radiating to the right shoul-
der. The gallbladder may become the site of acute infec-
tion and inflammation, resulting in symptoms of upper
right abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. This condi-
tion is referred to as cholecystitis. The surgical removal
of the gallbladder can provide relief of these symptoms.

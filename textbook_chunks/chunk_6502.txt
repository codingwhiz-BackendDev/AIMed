Some redness, swelling, blistering and oozing of
fluid are all common results of cryotherapy. Healing time
can vary by the site treated and the cryotherapy technique
used. When cryogen is applied directly to the growth,
healing may occur in three weeks. Growths treated on the
head and neck with the spray technique may take four to
six weeks to heal; growths treated on other areas of the
body may take considerably longer. Cryotherapy boasts
high success rates in permanently removing skin growths;
even for malignant lesions such as squamous cell and
basal cell cancers, studies have shown a cure rate of up to
98%. For certain types of growths, such as some forms of
warts, repeat treatments over several weeks are necessary
to prevent the growthâ€™s return.

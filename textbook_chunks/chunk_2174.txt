If a woman is diagnosed with very early-stage (IA)
cervical cancer while pregnant, the physician usually will
recommend a hysterectomy after the baby is born. For
later-stage cancers, the pregnancy is terminated or the
baby is removed by cesarean section as soon as it can
survive outside the womb. This is followed by a hysterec-
tomy and/or radiation treatment. For the most advanced
stages of cervical cancer, treatment is initiated despite
the pregnancy.
Many women with cervical cancer have hysterec-
tomies, which are major surgeries. Although normal
activities, including sexual intercourse, can be resumed
in four-eight weeks, a woman may have emotional prob-
lems following a hysterectomy. A strong support system
can help with these difficulties.

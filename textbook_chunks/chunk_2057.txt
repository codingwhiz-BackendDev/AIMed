Normal CSF is clear and colorless. It may be cloudy
in infections; straw- or yellow-colored if there is excess
protein, as may occur with cancer or inflammation;
blood-tinged if there was recent bleeding; or yellow to
brown (xanthochromic) if caused by an older instance of
bleeding.
A series of laboratory tests analyze the CSF for a
variety of substances to rule out possible medical disor-
ders of the central nervous system. The following are
normal values for commonly tested substances:
• CSF pressure: 50–180 mmH2O
• glucose: 40–85 mg/dL
• protein: 15–50 mg/dL
• leukocytes (white blood cells) total less than 5 per mL
• lymphocytes: 60–70%
• monocytes: 30–50%
• neutrophils: none
Normally, there are no red blood cells in the CSF
unless the needle passes though a blood vessel on route
to the CSF. If this is the case, there should be more red
blood cells in the first tube collected than in the last.

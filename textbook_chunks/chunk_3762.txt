Kidney failure is typically diagnosed and treated by a
nephrologist, a doctor that specializes in treating the kid-
neys. The patient that is suspected of having chronic kid-
ney failure will undergo an extensive blood work-up. A
blood test will assess the levels of creatinine, blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potas-
sium in the blood. Urine samples will also be collected,
usually over a 24-hour period, to assess protein loss.
Uncovering the cause of kidney failure is critical to
proper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is nec-
essary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable
and if the kidney failure is chronic or acute. An x ray,
MRI, computed tomography scan, ultrasound, renal
biopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys may be
employed to determine the cause of kidney failure and
level of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultra-
sound of the bladder and/or ureters may also be taken.

caused by the death of the parasites
include fever, headache, muscle pain, abdominal pain,
nausea and vomiting, weakness, dizziness, lethargy, and
asthma. Reactions usually begin within two days of start-

No treatment can reverse elephantiasis. Surgery may
be used to remove surplus tissue and provide a way to drain
the fluid around the damaged lymphatic vessels. Surgery
may also be used to ease massive enlargement of the scro-
tum. Elephantiasis of the legs can also be helped by elevat-
ing the legs and providing support with elastic bandages.

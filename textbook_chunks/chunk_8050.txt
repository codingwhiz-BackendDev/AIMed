The causes of diabetes mellitus are unclear, howev-
er, there seem to be both hereditary (genetic factors
passed on in families) and environmental factors
involved. Research has shown that some people who
develop diabetes have common genetic markers. In Type
I diabetes, the immune system, the bodyâ€™s defense sys-
tem against infection, is believed to be triggered by a
virus or another microorganism to destroy the cells in the
pancreas that produce insulin. In Type II diabetes, age,
obesity, and family history of diabetes play a roll.
In Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce
enough insulin, however, cells have become resistant to
the insulin produced and it may not work as effectively.

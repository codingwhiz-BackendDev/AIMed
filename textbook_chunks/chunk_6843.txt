Anti-motility medications—Medications such as
loperamide (sold as Imodium), dephenoxylate
(sold as Lomotil), or medications containing
codeine or narcotics that decrease the ability of
the intestine to contract. This can worsen the con-
dition of a patient with dysentery or colitis.
Cyst—A protective sac that includes either fluid or
the cell of an organism. The cyst enables many
organisms to survive in the environment for long
periods of time without need for food or water.
Immunocompromised—A change or alteration of
the immune system that normally serves to fight
off infections other illnesses. This can involve
changes in antibodies that the body produces
(hygogammaglobulinemia), or a defect in the cells
that partake in the immune response. Diseases
such as AIDS and cancer exhibit changes in the
body’s natural immunity.
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)—A liquid
preparation developed by the World Health Orga-
nization that can decrease fluid loss in persons
with diarrhea. Originally developed to be pre-
pared with materials available in the home, com-
mercial preparations have recently come into use.
Parasite—An organism that lives on or in another
and takes nourishment (food and fluids) from that
organism.
Protozoa—Group of extremely small single cell
(unicellular) or acellular organisms that are found
in moist soil or water. They tend to exist as para-
sites, living off other life forms.
Spore—A resistant form of certain species of bac-
teria, protozoa, and other organisms.
The use of the medication, trimethoprim-sulfameth-
oxazole (Bactrim) for one week can be successful in
treating intestinal infections and prevents relapse in those
with a normal immune system. The same medicine can
be prescribed to treat infections of both the intestine or
bile ducts in immunocompromised individuals, but main-
tenance or continuous treatment is often needed.

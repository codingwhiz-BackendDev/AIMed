Most cervical cancers are preventable. More than
90% of women with cervical cancer are infected with
HPV. HPV infection is the single most important risk
factor. This is particularly true for young women because
the cells lining the cervix do not fully mature until age
18. These immature cells are more susceptible to cancer-
causing agents and viruses.

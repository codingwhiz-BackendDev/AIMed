The only treatment for chancroid is antibiotics given
either once or for several days. Antibiotics taken by mouth
for one to two weeks include erythromycin (E-Mycin,
Ery-Tab), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin),
co-trimoxazole (Bactrim,
Septra),
or ciprofloxacin
(Cipro). Antibiotics given in one dose include ceftriaxone
(Rocephin), spectinomycin (Trobicin), co-trimoxazole, or
ofloxacin (Floxin).
The ulcer(s) may be cleaned and soaked to reduce
the swelling. Salt solution dressings may be applied to
the ulcer(s) to reduce the spread of the bacteria and pre-
vent additional ulcers. A serious infection of the foreskin
may require circumcision. Pus would be removed from
infected lymph nodes by using a needle and syringe.
Very large buboes may require surgical drainage.

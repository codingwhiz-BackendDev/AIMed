constricted space between the vertebrae, and misalign-
ment in the cervical spineâ€”in short, an x ray confirms
that a person has cervical spondylosis. To demonstrate
that the condition is causing the symptoms, more details
are needed. Other imaging tests, such as magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography myel-
ography, help assess effects of cervical spondylosis on
associated nerve tissue and blood vessels.
An MRI may be preferred, because it is a noninva-
sive procedure and does not require injecting a contrast
medium as does computed tomography myelography.
MRIs also have greater sensitivity for detecting disk
problems and spinal cord involvement, and the test
allows the physician to create images of a larger area
from various angles. However, these images may not
show enough detail about the vertebrae themselves. Com-
puted tomography myelography yields a superior image
of the bones involved in cervical spondylosis. Added ben-

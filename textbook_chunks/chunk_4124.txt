Clotting factor—Also known as coagulation fac-
tors. Proteins in the plasma which serve to activate
various parts of the blood clotting process by
being transformed from inactive to active form.
Enzyme—A substance that causes a chemical
reaction, usually a protein. Enzymes are secreted
by cells.
Hemorrhage—Abnormal bleeding from the blood
vessels.
Heparin—An anticoagulant, or blood clot “dis-
solver.”
Idiopathic—Refers to a disease of unknown cause,
and sometime to a primary disease.
Metastatic—The term used to describe a sec-
ondary cancer, or one that has spread from one
area of the body to another.
Serum reagents—Serum is fluid, or the fluid portion
of the blood retained after removal of the blood
cells and fibrin clot. Reagents are substances added
to the serum to produce a chemical reaction.
Thrombosis—Formation of a clot in the blood that
either blocks, or partially blocks a blood vessel.
The thrombus may lead to infarction, or death of
tissue, due to a blocked blood supply.
tors. Severe head trauma can expose blood to brain tissue.
No matter the cause of DIC, the results are a malfunction
of thrombin (an enzyme) and prothrombin (a glycopro-
tein), which activate the fibrinolytic system, releasing
clotting factors in the blood. DIC can alternate from hem-
orrhage to thrombosis, and both can exist, which further
complicates diagnosis and treatment.

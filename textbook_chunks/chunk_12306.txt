for FMF involves an oral medication called
colchicine, which is highly effective for the episodes of
fever and pain, as well as for amyloidosis and the kidney
disease that can result from it.
FMF is most common in certain ethnic groups from
the eastern Mediterranean region, but cases in other eth-
nic groups in other parts of the world are increasingly
being reported. FMF is also known by many other
names. They include: recurrent hereditary polyserositis,
benign paroxysmal peritonitis, familial paroxysmal pol-
yserositis, paroxysmal polyserositis, familial recurrent
polyserositis, periodic fever, periodic amyloid syndrome,
periodic peritonitis syndrome, Reimann periodic disease,
Reimann syndrome, Siegel-Cattan-Mamou syndrome,
and Armenian syndrome.
Estimates of the incidence of FMF in specific east-
ern Mediterranean populations range from 1 in 2000 to 1
in 100, depending on the population studied. Specific
mutations in the MEFV gene are more common in cer-
tain ethnic groups, and may cause a somewhat different
course of the disease. A few mutations in the MEFV
gene likely became common in a small population in the
eastern Mediterranean several thousand years ago. It is
postulated that carrying a single copy of a mutated gene
produced a modified (but not abnormal) inflammatory
response that may have been protective against some
infectious agent at that time. Those who carried a single
“beneficial” mutation in the MEFV gene were more like-
ly to survive and reproduce, which may explain the high
carrier frequency (up to one in five) in some populations.
People of Armenian, Sephardic-Jewish, Arabic, and
Turkish ancestry are at greatest risk for FMF. However, a
better understanding and recognition of the symptoms of
FMF in recent years has resulted in more reports of the
condition in other ethnic groups, such as Italians and
Armenian-Americans.

Diagnosis of cholecystitis involves a careful abdomi-
nal examination. The enlarged, tender gallbladder may be
felt through the abdominal wall. Pressure in the upper
right corner of the abdomen may cause the patient to stop
breathing in, due to an increase in pain. This is called
Murphyâ€™s sign. Physical examination may also reveal an
increased heart rate and an increased rate of breathing.
Blood tests will show an increase in the white blood
count, as well as an increase in bilirubin. Ultrasound is
used to look for gallstones and to measure the thickness
of the gallbladder wall (a marker of inflammation and
scarring). A scan of the liver and gallbladder, with careful
attention to the system of ducts throughout (called the bil-
iary tree) is also used to demonstrate obstruction of ducts.

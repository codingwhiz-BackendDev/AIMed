Any respiratory disease or malfunction that affects
the circulatory system of the lungs may lead to cor pul-
monale. These circulatory changes cause the right ventri-
cle to compensate for the extra work required to pump
blood through the lungs. The right ventricle has thin
walls and is crescent-shaped. The resulting pressure
causes the right ventricle to dilate and bulge, eventually
leading to its failure.
Cor pulmonale should be expected in any patient
with COPD and other respiratory or neuromuscular dis-
eases. Initial symptoms of cor pulmonale may actually
reflect those of the underlying disease. These may
include chronic coughing, wheezing, weakness, fatigue,
and shortness of breath. Edema (abnormal buildup of
fluid), weakness, and discomfort in the upper chest may
be evident in cor pulmonale.

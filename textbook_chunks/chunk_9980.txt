In reading and interpreting brainwave patterns, a
neurologist or other physician will evaluate the type of
brainwaves and the symmetry, location, and consistency
of brainwave patterns. He will also look at the brain-
wave response to certain stimuli presented during the
EEG test (such as flashing lights or noise). There are
four basic types of brainwaves: alpha, beta, theta, and
delta. “Normal” brainwave patterns vary widely,
depending on factors of age and activity. For example,
awake and relaxed individuals typically register an alpha
wave pattern of eight to 13 cycles per second. Young

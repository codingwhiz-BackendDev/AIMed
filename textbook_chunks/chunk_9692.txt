A third copy of chromosome 18 causes numerous
abnormalities. Most children born with Edwardsâ€™ syn-
drome appear weak and fragile, and they are often under-
weight. The head is unusually small and the back of the
head is prominent. The ears are malformed and low-set,
and the mouth and jaw are small. The baby may also
have a cleft lip or cleft palate. Frequently, the hands are
clenched into fists, and the index finger overlaps the
other fingers. The child may have clubfeet and toes may
be webbed or fused.
Numerous problems involving the internal organs
may be present. Abnormalities often occur in the lungs
and diaphragm (the muscle that controls breathing), and
heart defects and blood vessel malformations are com-
mon. The child may also have malformed kidneys and
abnormalities of the urogenital system.

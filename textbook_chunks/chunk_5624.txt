There are two Coombs’ tests. A direct Coombs’ test
detects the two different antigens that might induce
hemolysis in the patient’s red blood cells. An indirect
Coombs’ test looks for antibodies to someone else’s red
blood cells in the patient’s serum (the blood without the
cells). Combining the two tests gives clues to the origin
of the hemolysis.

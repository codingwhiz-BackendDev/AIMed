An unruptured aneurysm may not cause any symp-
toms over an entire lifetime. Surgical clip ligation will
ensure that it won’t rupture, but it may be better to leave
the aneurysm alone in some cases. Familial cerebral
aneurysms may rupture earlier than those without a
genetic link.
The outlook is not as good for a person who suffers a
ruptured aneurysm. Fifteen to twenty-five percent of
people who experience a ruptured aneurysm do not sur-
vive. An additional 25–50% die as a result of complica-
tions associated with the hemorrhage. Of the survivors,
15–50% suffer permanent brain damage and disability.
These conditions are caused by the death of nerve cells.
Nerve cells can be destroyed by the hemorrhage itself or
by complications from the hemorrhage, such as
vasospasm or hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus, a dilata-
tion (expansion) of the fluid-filled cavity surrounding the
brain, occurs in about 15% of cases. Immediate medical
treatment is vital to prevent further complications and
brain damage in those who survive the initial rupture.
Patients who survive SAH and aneurysm clipping are
unlikely to die from events related to SAH.

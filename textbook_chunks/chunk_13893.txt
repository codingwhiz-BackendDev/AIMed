Fractures involving joint surfaces almost always lead
to some degree of arthritis of the joint. Fractures can nor-
mally be cured with proper first aid and appropriate after-
care. If determined necessary by a physician, the frac-
tured site should be manipulated, realigned, and immobi-
lized as soon as possible. Realignment has been shown to
be much more difficult after six hours. Healing time
varies from person to person with the elderly generally
needing more time to heal completely. A non-union frac-
ture may result when a fracture does not heal, such as in
the case of an elderly person or an individual with med-
ical complications. Recovery is complete when there is no
bone motion at the fracture site, and x rays indicate com-
plete healing. Open fractures may lead to bone infections,
which delay the healing process. Another possible com-
plication is compartment syndrome, a painful condition
resulting from the expansion of enclosed tissue and that
may occur when a body part is immobilized in a cast.

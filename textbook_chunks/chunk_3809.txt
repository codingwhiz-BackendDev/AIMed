Emphysema is a disease in which cigarette smoke
causes an overproduction of the enzyme elastase, one of
the immune systemâ€™s infection-fighting biochemicals.
This results in irreversible destruction of a protein in the
lung called elastin which is important for maintaining the
structure of the walls of the alveoli, the terminal small air
sacs of the respiratory system. As the walls of the alveoli
rupture, the number of alveoli is reduced and many of
those remaining are enlarged, making the lungs of the
patient with emphysema less elastic and overinflated.
Due to the higher pressure inside the chest that must be
developed to force air out of the less-elastic lungs, the
bronchioles, small air tubes of the respiratory system,
tend to collapse during exhalation. Stale air gets trapped
in the air sacs and fresh air cannot be brought in.

In peritoneal dialysis (PD), the patient’s peritoneum,
or lining of the abdomen, acts as a blood filter. A catheter
is surgically inserted into the patient’s abdomen. During
treatment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavity
with dialysate. Waste products and excess fluids move
from the patient’s bloodstream into the dialysate solu-
tion. After a waiting period of six to 24 hours, depending
on the treatment method used, the waste-filled dialysate
is drained from the abdomen, and replaced with clean
dialysate. There are three types of peritoneal dialysis,
which vary by treatment time and administration
method: Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis

DKA is most commonly seen in individuals with
type I diabetes, under 19 years of age and is usually
caused by the interruption of their insulin treatment or
by acute infection or trauma. A small number of people
with type II diabetes also experience ketoacidosis, but
this is rare given the fact that type II diabetics still pro-
duce some insulin naturally. When DKA occurs in type
II patients, it is usually caused by a decrease in food
intake and an increased insulin deficiency due to hyper-
glycemia.

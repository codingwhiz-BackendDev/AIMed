Aminocentesis—A procedure performed at 16–18
weeks of pregnancy in which a needle is inserted
through a woman’s abdomen into her uterus to
draw out a small sample of the amniotic fluid from
around the baby. Either the fluid itself or cells from
the fluid can be used for a variety of tests to obtain
information about genetic disorders and other med-
ical conditions in the fetus.
Centromere—The centromere is the constricted
region of a chromosome. It performs certain func-
tions during cell division.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)—A procedure
used for prenatal diagnosis at 10–12 weeks gesta-
tion. Under ultrasound guidance a needle is insert-
ed either through the mother’s vagina or abdomi-
nal wall and a sample of cells is collected from
around the early embryo. These cells are then test-
ed for chromosome abnormalities or other genetic
diseases.
Chromosome—A microscopic thread-like structure
found within each cell of the body and consists of a
complex of proteins and DNA. Humans have 46
chromosomes arranged into 23 pairs. Changes in
either the total number of chromosomes or their
shape and size (structure) may lead to physical or
mental abnormalities.
Congenital—Refers to a disorder that is present at
birth.
Deletion—The absence of genetic material that is
normally found in a chromosome. Often, the genet-
ic material is missing due to an error in replication
of an egg or sperm cell.
Hypotonia—Reduced or diminished muscle tone.
Karyotyping—A laboratory procedure in which
chromosomes are separated from cells, stained and
arranged so that their structure can be studied
under the microscope.
Microcephaly—An abnormally small head.
Cri du chat syndrome can be detected before birth if
the mother undergoes amniocentesis testing or chorionic
villus sampling(CVS). This testing would only be recom-
mended if the mother or father is known to have a chro-
mosome rearrangement, or if they already have a child
with cri du chat syndrome.

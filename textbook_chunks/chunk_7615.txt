Delusions that are symptomatic of delusional disor-
der should be treated by a psychologist and/or psychia-
trist. Though antipsychotic drugs are often not effec-
tive, antipsychotic medication such as thioridazine (Mel-
laril), haloperidol (Haldol), chlorpromazine (Thorazine),
clozapine (Clozaril), or risperidone (Risperdal) may be
prescribed, and cognitive therapy or psychotherapy may
be attempted.
If an underlying condition such as schizophrenia,
depression, or drug abuse is found to be triggering the
delusions, an appropriate course of medication and/or
psychosocial therapy is employed to treat the primary
disorder. The medication, typically, will include an
antipsychotic agent.

and diagnoses that may lead to perform-
ing this procedure include:
• chest pain, characterized by prolonged heavy pressure
or a squeezing pain
• abnormal treadmill stress test
• myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack
• congenital heart defects, or heart problems that origi-
nated from birth
• a diagnosis of valvular-heart disease
• a need to measure the heart muscle’s ability to pump
blood
Typically performed along with angiography, a tech-
nique of injecting a dye into the vascular system to outline
the heart and blood vessels, a catheterization can aid in the
visualization of any blockages, narrowing, or abnormalities
in the coronary arteries. If these signs are visible, the cardi-
ologist may assess the patient’s need and readiness for
coronary bypass surgery, or perhaps a less invasive
approach, such as dilation of a narrowed blood vessel either
surgically or with the use of a balloon (angioplasty).
When looking at the left side of the heart, fluoro-
scopic guidance also allows the following diagnoses to
be assessed:
• enlargement of the left ventricle
• ventricular aneurysms (abnormal dilation of a blood
vessel)
• narrowing of the aortic valve
• insufficiency of the aortic or mitral valve
• the detour of blood from one side of the heart to the
other due to septal defects (also known as shunting)

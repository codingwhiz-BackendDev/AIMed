The prognosis for children with CD is not bright.
Follow-up studies of conduct disordered children have
shown a high incidence of antisocial personality disor-
der, affective illnesses, and chronic criminal behavior
later in life. However, proper treatment of co-existing
disorders, early identification and intervention, and
long-term support may improve the outlook signifi-
cantly.

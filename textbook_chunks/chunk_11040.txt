Eosinophilic pneumonia may not respond to drugs
used to treat asthma. Eosinophilic pneumonia is usually
treated with steroids, particularly glucocorticosteroids.
Steroids are not effective against infectious agents, but
the main disease process in eosinophilic pneumonia is an
inflammatory reaction, not a response to infection. When
eosinophilia is produced as a consequence of asthma or
an infection by helminths, treatment of the asthma or
helminths will reduce the eosinophilia.

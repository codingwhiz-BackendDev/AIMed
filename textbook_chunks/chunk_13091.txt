Once a specific disorder within the broad category
of fibrocystic condition is identified, treatment can be
prescribed. There are a number of treatment options for
women with a lump that has been diagnosed as benign. If
it is not causing a great deal of pain, the growth may be
left in the breast. However, some women may choose to
have a lump such as a fibroadenoma surgically removed,
especially if it is large. Another option to relieve the dis-
comfort of a painful benign lump is to have the cyst suc-
tioned, or drained. If there is any uncertainty regarding
diagnosis, the fluid may be sent to the lab for analysis.

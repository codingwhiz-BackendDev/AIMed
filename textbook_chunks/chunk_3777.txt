Kidney transplantation involves surgically attaching
a functioning kidney, or graft, from a brain dead organ
donor (a cadaver transplant), or from a living donor, to a
patient with ESRD. Patients with chronic renal disease
who need a transplant and don’t have a living donor reg-
ister with UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing),
the federal organ procurement agency, to be placed on a
waiting list for a cadaver kidney transplant. Kidney avail-
ability is based on the patient’s health status. When the
new kidney is transplanted, the patient’s existing, dis-
eased kidneys may or may not be removed, depending on
the circumstances surrounding the kidney failure. A regi-
men of immunosuppressive, or anti-rejection medication,
is required after transplantation surgery.

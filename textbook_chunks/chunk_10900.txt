An enterostomy is an operation in which the surgeon
makes a passage into the patientâ€™s small intestine through
the abdomen with an opening to allow for drainage or to
insert a tube for feeding. The opening is called a stoma,
from the Greek word for mouth. Enterostomies may be
either temporary or permanent. They are classified accord-
ing to the part of the intestine that is used to create the
stoma. If the ileum, which is the lowest of the three sec-
tions of the small intestine, is used to make the stoma, the
operation is called an ileostomy. If the jejunum, which is
the middle section of the small intestine, is used, the oper-
ation is called a jejunostomy. Some people use the word
ostomy as a word that covers all types of enterostomies.

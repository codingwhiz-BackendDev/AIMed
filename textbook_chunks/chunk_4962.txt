Many cases of concussion can be prevented by using
appropriate protective equipment. This includes seat
belts and air bags in automobiles, and helmets in all con-
tact sports. Helmets should also be worn when bicycling,
skiing, or horseback riding. Soccer players should avoid
heading the ball when it is kicked at high velocity from
close range. Playground equipment should be underlaid
with soft material, either sand or special matting.
The value of high-contact sports such as boxing,
football, or hockey should be weighed against the high
risk of brain injury during a young person’s participation
in the sport. Steering a child’s general enthusiasm for
sports into activities less apt to produce head impacts
may reduce the likelihood of brain injury.

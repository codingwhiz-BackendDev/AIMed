Over 90% of all cellulitis cases are cured after seven to
10 days of antibiotic treatment. Persons with serious dis-
ease and/or those who are taking immunosuppressive drugs
may experience a more severe form of cellulitis which can
be life threatening. Serious complications include blood
poisoning (bacteria growing in the blood stream), meningi-
tis (brain and spinal cord infection), tissue death (necrosis),
and/or lymphangitis (infection of the lymph vessels).
Severe cellulitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes can
lead to destructive and life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis.

Definition
Enterobacterial infections are disorders of the diges-
tive tract and other organ systems produced by a group of
gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria called Enterobacteri-
aceae. Gram-negative means that the organisms do not
retain the violet color of the dye used to make Gram
stains. The most troublesome organism in this group is
Escherichia coli. Other enterobacteria are species of Sal-
monella, Shigella, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia,
Proteus, and Yersinia.

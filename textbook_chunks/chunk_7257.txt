ahead of time, a living will is an attempt to address this
dilemma. By outlining the conditions under which one
would rather be allowed to die, a person can contribute
significantly to that final decision, even if not competent
to do so at the time of actual death. The problem is that
there are uncertainties surrounding every severely ill
person. Each instance presents a greater or lesser chance
of survival. The chance is often greater than zero. The
best living will follows an intimate discussion with deci-
sion makers covering the many possible scenarios sur-
rounding the end of life. This discussion is difficult, for
few people like to contemplate their own demise. How-
ever, the benefits of a living will are substantial, both to
physicians and to loved ones who are faced with making
final decisions. Most states have passed living will laws,
honoring instructions on artificial life support that were
made while a person was still mentally competent.

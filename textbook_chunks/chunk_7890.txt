Women who have been exposed to DES should have
a pelvic exam at least once a year. In addition to the usual
pelvic exam and Pap smear, DES daughters should also
have Pap smears of the vagina and, if possible, col-
poscopy. During colposcopy, the doctor looks at the
cervix and vagina through a special magnifying scope. In
this way, tiny areas of abnormal cells can be seen. This
procedure is easily performed in the doctor’s office.
When DES daughters get pregnant, they may be at
high risk for premature labor and birth and should be
monitored very carefully.
Not all women who were exposed to DES develop
problems in pregnancy. However, if problems like infer-
tility or miscarriage do occur, the doctor may recom-
mend a special x-ray test to check the woman’s fallopian
tubes and uterus. This special test is called a hysterosalp-
ingogram.

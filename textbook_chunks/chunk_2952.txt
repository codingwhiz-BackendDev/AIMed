As the mother enters the second stage of labor, her
baby’s head appears at the top of the cervix. Uterine con-
tractions get stronger. The infant passes down the vagina,
helped along by contractions of the abdominal muscles
and the mother’s pushing. Active pushing by the mother
is very important during this phase of labor. If an epidur-
al anesthetic is being used, many practitioners recom-
mend decreasing the amount administered during this
phase of labor so that the mother has better control over
her abdominal muscles.
When the top of the baby’s head appears at the open-
ing of the vagina, the birth is nearing completion. First
the head passes under the pubic bone. It fills the lower
vagina and stretches the perineum (the tissues between
the vagina and the rectum). This position is called
“crowning,” since only the crown of the head is visible.
When the entire head is out, the shoulders follow. The
attending practitioner suctions the baby’s mouth and
nose to ease the baby’s first breath. The rest of the baby
usually slips out easily, and the umbilical cord is cut.

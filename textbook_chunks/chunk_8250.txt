Hematocrit (Hct) levels, a measure of red blood
cells, are typically low in ESRD patients. This deficiency
is caused by a lack of the hormone erythropoietin, which
is normally produced by the kidneys. The problem is ele-
vated in hemodialysis patients, who may incur blood loss
during hemodialysis treatments. Epoetin alfa, or EPO
(sold under the trade name Epogen), a hormone therapy,
and intravenous or oral iron supplements are used to
manage anemia in dialysis patients.
Cramps, nausea, vomiting, and headaches
Some hemodialysis patients experience cramps and
flu-like symptoms during treatment. These can be caused
by a number of factors, including the type of dialysate
used, composition of the dialyzer membrane, water qual-
ity in the dialysis unit, and the ultrafiltration rate of the
treatment. Adjustment of the dialysis prescription often
helps alleviate many symptoms.

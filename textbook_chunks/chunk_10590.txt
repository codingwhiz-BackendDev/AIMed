If a doctor suspects endometriosis, the first step will
be to perform a pelvic exam to try to feel if implants are
present. Very often there is no strong evidence of
endometriosis from a physical exam. The only way to
make a definitive diagnosis is through minor surgery
called a laparoscopy. A laparoscope, a slender scope with
a light on the end, is inserted into the woman’s abdomen
through a small incision near her belly button. This allows
the doctor to examine the internal organs for endometriotic
growths. Often, a sample of tissue is taken for later exami-
nation in the laboratory. Endometriosis is sometimes dis-
covered when a woman has abdominal surgery for another
reason such as tubal ligation or hysterectomy.
Various imaging techniques such as ultrasound,
computed tomography scan (CT scan), or magnetic res-
onance imaging (MRI) can offer additional information
but aren’t useful in making the initial diagnosis. A blood
test may also be ordered because women with
endometriosis have higher levels of the blood protein
CA125. Testing for this substance before and after treat-
ment can predict a recurrence of the disease, but the test
is not reliable as a diagnostic tool.

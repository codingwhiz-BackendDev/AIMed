The best treatment for contact dermatitis is to identify
the allergen or irritating substance and avoid further con-
tact with it. If the culprit is, for instance, a cosmetic, avoid-
ance is a simple matter, but in some situations, such as an
allergy to an essential workplace chemical for which no
substitute can be found, avoidance may be impossible or
force the sufferer to find new work or make other drastic
changes in his or her life. Barrier creams and protective
clothing such as gloves, masks, and long-sleeved shirts are
ways of coping with contact dermatitis when avoidance is
impossible, though they are not always effective.
For the symptoms themselves, treatments in mild
cases include cool compresses and nonprescription
lotions and ointments. When the symptoms are severe,
corticosteroids applied to the skin or taken orally are
used. Contact dermatitis that leads to a bacterial skin
infection is treated with antibiotics.

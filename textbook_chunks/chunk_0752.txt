One out of every four deaths in the United States is
from cancer. It is second only to heart disease as a cause
of death in the states. About 1.2 million Americans are
diagnosed with cancer annually; more than 500,000 die
of cancer annually.
Cancer can attack anyone. Since the occurrence of
cancer increases as individuals age, most of the cases are
seen in adults, middle-aged or older. Sixty percent of all
cancers are diagnosed in people who are older than 65
years of age. The most common cancers are skin cancer,
lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer (in women),
and prostate cancer (in men). In addition, cancer of the
kidneys, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, bladder, rectum, and
blood and lymph node cancer (leukemias and lym-
phomas) are also included among the 12 major cancers
that affect most Americans.

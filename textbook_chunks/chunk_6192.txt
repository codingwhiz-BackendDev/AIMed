There are also 10 authoritative textbooks on this therapy.
The most notable scientific papers include Viola M. Fry-
manâ€™s work documenting the successful treatment of
1,250 newborn children with birth defects. Edna Lay and
Stephen Blood showed the effects on TMD, and John
Wood documented results with psychiatric disorders.

therapy to be an effective adjunct to orthodontic work.
However, the conventional medical community has not
endorsed these techniques.

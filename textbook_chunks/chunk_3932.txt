A balanced diet promotes regeneration of healthy
liver cells. Eating five or six small meals throughout the
day should prevent the sick or bloated feeling patients
with cirrhosis often have after eating. Alcohol and caf-
feine, which destroy liver cells, should be avoided. So
should any foods that upset the stomach. Patients with
brain disease associated with cirrhosis should avoid
excessive amounts of protein in the diet.
A patient can keep a food diary that describes what
was eaten, when it was eaten, and how the patient felt
afterwards. This diary can be useful in identifying foods
that are hard to digest and in scheduling meals to coin-
cide with the times the patient is most hungry.
Patients who have cirrhosis should weigh them-
selves every day and notify their doctor of a sudden gain
of five pounds or more. A doctor should also be notified
if symptoms of cirrhosis appear in anyone who has not
been diagnosed with the disease. A doctor should also be
notified if a patient diagnosed with cirrhosis:
• vomits blood
• passes black stools
• seems confused or unresponsive
• shows signs of infection (redness, swelling, tenderness,
pain)

Some families are not considered suitable candidates
for family therapy. They include:
• families in which one, or both, of the parents is psy-
chotic or has been diagnosed with antisocial or para-
noid personality disorder,
• families whose cultural or religious values are opposed
to, or suspicious of, psychotherapy,
• families with members who cannot participate in treat-
ment sessions because of physical illness or similar
limitations,
• families with members with very rigid personality
structures, (here, members might be at risk for an emo-
tional or psychological crisis),
• families whose members cannot or will not be able to
meet regularly for treatment,
• families that are unstable or on the verge of breakup.

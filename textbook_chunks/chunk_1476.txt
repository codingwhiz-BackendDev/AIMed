A family doctor should be called whenever a cat
scratch or bite fails to heal normally or is followed by a
persistent fever or other unusual symptoms such as long-
lasting bone or joint pain. The appearance of painful and
swollen lymph nodes is another reason for consulting a
doctor. When cat-scratch disease is suspected, the doctor
will ask about a history of exposure to cats and look for
evidence of a cat scratch or bite and swollen lymph
nodes. A blood test for Bartonella henselae may be
ordered to confirm the doctorâ€™s diagnosis.

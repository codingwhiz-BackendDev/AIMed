Echocardiography creates an image of the heart
using ultra-high-frequency sound waves—sound waves
that are too high in frequency to be heard by the human
ear. The technique is very similar to ultrasound scanning
commonly used to visualize the fetus during pregnancy.
An echocardiography examination generally lasts
between 15–30 minutes. The patient lies bare-chested on
an examination table. A special gel is spread over the
chest to help the transducer make good contact and slide
smoothly over the skin. The transducer, a small hand-held
device at the end of a flexible cable, is placed against the
chest. Essentially a modified microphone, the transducer
directs ultrasound waves into the chest. Some of the
waves get echoed (or reflected) back to the transducer.
Since different tissues and blood all reflect ultrasound
waves differently, these sound waves can be translated
into a meaningful image of the heart, which can be dis-
played on a monitor or recorded on paper or tape. The
patient does not feel the sound waves, and the entire pro-
cedure is painless. In fact, there are no known side effects.
Occasionally, variations of the echocardiography
test are used. For example, Doppler echocardiography
employs a special microphone that allows technicians to
measure and analyze the direction and speed of blood
flow through blood vessels and heart valves. This makes
it especially useful for detecting and evaluating regurgi-
tation through the heart valves. By assessing the speed of
blood flow at different locations around an obstruction, it
can also help to precisely locate the obstruction.
An exercise echocardiogram is an echocardiogram
performed during exercise, when the heart muscle must
work harder to supply blood to the body. This allows
doctors to detect heart problems that might not be evi-
dent when the body is at rest and needs less blood. For

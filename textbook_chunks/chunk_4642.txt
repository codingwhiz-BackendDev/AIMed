A colostomy is created as a means to treat various
disorders of the large intestine, including cancer, obstruc-
tion, inflammatory bowel disease, ruptured diverticulum,
ischemia (compromised blood supply), or traumatic
injury. Temporary colostomies are created to divert stool
from injured or diseased portions of the large intestine,
allowing rest and healing. Permanent colostomies are per-
formed when the distal bowel (bowel at the farthest dis-
tance) must be removed or is blocked and inoperable.
Although colorectal cancer is the most common indica-
tion for a permanent colostomy, only about 10â€“15% of
patients with this diagnosis require a colostomy.

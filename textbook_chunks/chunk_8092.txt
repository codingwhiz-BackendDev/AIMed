Uncontrolled diabetes is a leading cause of blind-
ness, end-stage renal disease, and limb amputations. It
also doubles the risks of heart disease and increases the
risk of stroke. Eye problems including cataracts, glau-
coma, and diabetic retinopathy are also more common in
diabetics.
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a condition
where nerve endings, particularly in the legs and feet
become less sensitive. Diabetic foot ulcers are a partic-
ular problem since the patient does not feel the pain of
a blister, callous, or other minor injury. Poor blood cir-
culation in the legs and feet contribute to delayed
wound healing. The inability to sense pain along with
the complications of delayed wound healing can result
in minor injuries, blisters, or callouses becoming
infected and difficult to treat. In cases of severe infec-
tion, the infected tissue begins to break down and rot
away. The most serious consequence of this condition
is the need for amputation of toes, feet, or legs due to
severe infection.
Heart disease and kidney disease are common com-
plications of diabetes. Long-term complications may
include the need for kidney dialysis or a kidney trans-
plant due to kidney failure.
Babies born to diabetic mothers have an increased
risk of birth defects and distress at birth.

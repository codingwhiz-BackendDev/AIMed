Genetics is thought to play a role in eye cancer. In
regards to retinoblastoma, it is believed that if a tumor
develops only in one eye then it isnâ€™t hereditary. Howev-
er, if a tumor occurs in both eyes then it is hereditary.
Those who have hereditary retinoblastoma have a rare
risk of developing a tumor in the brain and should be
monitored on a regular basis.
The cause of intraocular melanoma is still vague.
Genetics could play a role, but age is also a factor. Inter-
estingly enough, this type of cancer is seen most often in
white people from a northern European descent.
The symptoms of this type of cancer usually begin
with blurred vision and tenderness of the eye. Advanced
symptoms may include loss of vision. If these symptoms
persist a person should make an appointment with their
ophthalmologist.

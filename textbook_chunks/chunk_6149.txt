Do not take more than the recommended daily
dosage of dextromethorphan.
Dextromethorphan is not meant to be used for
coughs associated with smoking, asthma, emphysema,
chronic bronchitis, or other lung conditions. It also
should not be used for coughs that produce mucus.
A lingering cough could be a sign of a serious med-
ical condition. Coughs that last more than seven days or
are associated with fever, rash, sore throat, or lasting
headache should have medical attention. Call a physi-
cian as soon as possible.
People with phenylketonuria should be aware that
some products with dextromethorphan also contain the
artificial sweetener aspartame, which breaks down in the
body to phenylalanine.
Anyone who has asthma or liver disease should
check with a physician before taking dextromethorphan.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who
plan to become pregnant should check with their physi-
cians before taking dextromethorphan.
The dye tartrazine is an ingredient in some cough
suppressant products. This dye causes allergic reactions
in some people, especially those who are allergic to
aspirin.

This condition usually results from a diet lacking in
foods with high folic acid content, or from the body’s
inability to digest foods or absorb foods having high folic
acid content. Other factors that increase the risk of devel-
oping folic acid deficiency anemia are:
• age
• alcoholism
• birth-control pills, anticonvulsant therapy, sulfa antibi-
otics, and certain other medications
• illness
• smoking
• stress
Fatigue is often the first sign of folic acid deficiency
anemia. Other symptoms include:
• anorexia nervosa
• pale skin
• paranoia
• rapid heart beat
• sore, inflamed tongue
• weakness
• weight loss

Removing the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes is
the only permanent method of eliminating endometrio-
sis. This is an extreme measure that deprives a woman of
her ability to bear children and forces her body into
menopause. Endometrial implants and ovarian cysts can
be removed with laser surgery performed through a
laparoscope. For women with minimal endometriosis,
this technique is usually successful in reducing pain and
slowing the conditionâ€™s progress. It may also help infer-
tile women increase their chances of becoming pregnant.

Electrical stimulation of the brain, or deep brain
stimulation, is effective in treating tremors in up to 88%
of Parkinson disease patients. An electrode is implanted
into the thalamus (part of the brain) of the patient, and
attached to an electric pulse generator via an extension
wire. The pulse generator is implanted into the patientâ€™s
pectoral, or chest area, and the extension wire is tunneled
under the skin. The pulse generator sends out intermit-
tent electrical stimulation to the electrode in the thala-
mus, which inhibits or partially relieves the tremor. The
generator can be turned on and off with a magnet, and
needs to be replaced every three to five years.
Similar methods have been used to treat chronic pain
that responded unfavorably to conventional therapies. A
remote transmitter allows these patients to trigger elec-

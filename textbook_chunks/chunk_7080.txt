Cystometry can be somewhat uncomfortable. The
patient may wish to reserve an hour or so afterward to
recover. Urinary frequency or urgency, and some redden-
ing of the urine, may last for a day. Increasing fluid intake
helps to flush out the bladder, but caffeinated, carbonated,
or alcoholic beverages are discouraged, because they may
irritate the bladder lining. Signs of infection, such as
fever, chills, low back pain, or persistent blood in the
urine, should be reported to the examining physician.

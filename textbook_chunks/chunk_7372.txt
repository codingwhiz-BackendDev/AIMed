Decongestants are sold in many forms, including
tablets, capsules, caplets, gelcaps, liqui-caps, liquids,
nasal sprays, and nose drops. These drugs are sometimes
combined with other medicines in cold and allergy prod-
ucts designed to relieve several symptoms. Some decon-
gestant products require a physicianâ€™s prescription, but
there are also many nonprescription (over-the-counter)
products. Ask a physician or pharmacist about choosing
an appropriate decongestant.
Commonly used decongestants include oxymetazo-
line (Afrin and other brands) and pseudoephedrine
(Sudafed, Actifed, and other brands). The decongestant
oxymetazoline is also used in some eye drops to relieve
redness and itching.
The recommended dosage depends on the drug.
Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the
pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct
dosage, and always take the medicine exactly as directed.
If using nonprescription (over-the-counter) types, follow
the directions on the package label or ask a pharmacist
for assistance. Never take larger or more frequent doses,
and do not take the drug for longer than directed.

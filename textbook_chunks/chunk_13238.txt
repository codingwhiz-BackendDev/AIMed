Accidental amputations will usually result in profuse
bleeding and tissue loss. Injuries to the pulp can occur as
from fast moving mechanical instruments, such as drills.
These injuries may puncture the pulp. Injuries such as a
subungal hematoma are caused by a crushing type injury.
Fractures typically occur as the result of crushing injuries
or tendon avulsion. These crushing injuries are frequently
caused during sport injury and can be treated by simple
interventions such as immobilization or more complex
procedures if tendons are affected (the trauma is then
treated as a tendon injury). Fractures can cause pain and,
depending on the extent of swelling, there may be some
restriction of movement. Tendon injuries can be caused
when the terminal joint is exposed to force flexing motion
(moving the finger toward the palm) while held straight.

The prognosis for patients with mild forms of coag-
ulation disorders is normally good. Many people can
lead a normal life and maintain a normal life expectancy.
Without treatment of bleeding episodes, severe muscle
and joint pain, and eventually, damage, can occur. Any
incident that causes blood to collect in the head, neck, or
digestive system can be very serious and requires imme-
diate attention. DIC can be severe enough to cause clots
to form and a stroke could occur. DIC is also serious
enough to cause gangrene in the fingers, nose, or geni-
tals. The prognosis depends on early intervention and
treatment of the underlying condition. Hemorrhage from
a coagulation disorder, particularly into the brain or
digestive track, can prove fatal. In the past, patients who
received regular transfusions of human blood products
were subject to increased risk of AIDS and other dis-
eases. However, efforts have been made since the early
1990s to ensure the safety of the blood supply.

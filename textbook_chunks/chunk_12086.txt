A chalazion is an enlargement of a meibomian gland
(an oil-producing gland in the eyelid), usually not associ-
ated with an infectious agent. More likely, the gland
opening is clogged. Initially, a chalazion may resemble a
stye, but it usually grows larger. A chalazion may also be
located in the middle of the lid and be internal.

Cryptococcosis is an infection caused by inhaling
the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. It is one of the dis-
eases most often affecting AIDS patients. Cryptococco-
sis may be limited to the lungs, but frequently spreads
throughout the body. Although almost any organ can be
infected, the fungus is often fatal if it infects the nervous
system where it causes an inflammation of the mem-
branes covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).

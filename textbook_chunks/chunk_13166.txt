In very rare instances, the virus can cause inflamma-
tion of different areas of the body, including the brain
(encephalitis), the covering of the brain and spinal cord
(meningitis), the lungs (pneumonitis), the liver (hepati-
tis), and the heart muscle (myocarditis). The virus can
also aggravate symptoms for people with an autoimmune
disease called systemic lupus erythematosus.
There is some concern about fifth disease in pregnant
women. Although no association with an increased number
of birth defects has been demonstrated, there is concern
that infection during the first three months of pregnancy
may lead to a slight increase in the number of miscarriages.
There is also some concern that infection later in pregnancy
may involve a very small risk of premature delivery or still-
births. As a result, women who get fifth disease while they
are pregnant should be monitored closely by a physician.

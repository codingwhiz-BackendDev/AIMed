Detoxification is helpful for those patients suffering
from many chronic diseases and conditions, including
allergies, anxiety, arthritis, asthma, chronic infections,
depression, diabetes, headaches, heart disease, high
cholesterol, low blood sugar levels, digestive disorders,
mental illness, and obesity. It is helpful for those with
conditions that are influenced by environmental factors,
such as cancer, as well as for those who have been
exposed to high levels of toxic materials due to accident
or occupation. Detoxification therapy is useful for those
suffering from allergies or immune system problems
that conventional medicine is unable to diagnose or
treat, including chronic fatigue syndrome, environ-
mental illness/multiple chemical sensitivity,
and
fibromyalgia. Symptoms for those suffering these con-
ditions may include unexplained fatigue, increased
allergies, hypersensitivity to common materials, intoler-
ance to certain foods and indigestion, aches and pains,
low grade fever, headaches, insomnia, depression, sore
throats, sudden weight loss or gain, lowered resistance
to infection, general malaise, and disability. Detoxifica-
tion can be used as a beneficial preventative measure
and as a tool to increase overall health, vitality, and
resistance to disease.

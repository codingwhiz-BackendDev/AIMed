can be close enough to be confusing. However, the pres-
ence of a pus-filled lump in the groin of a patient with a
genital ulcer is highly specific for chancroid.
For a clear-cut diagnosis of chancroid, Haemophilus
ducreyi must be isolated from the ulcer. To do this, a ster-
ile cotton swab is wiped over the ulcer to obtain a pus
sample. In the laboratory, the sample is put into special
media and placed in an incubator. Haemophilus ducreyi
takes from two to five days to grow in the laboratory. In
addition, the pus may be examined under the microscope
to see which bacteria are in the ulcer. A sample of the pus
may also be tested to see if the herpes virus is present. A
blood sample will probably be taken from the patientâ€™s
arm to test for the presence of antibodies to the bacteria
that causes syphilis.

Atherosclerosis—A disease of the coronary arteries
in which cholesterol is deposited in plaques on the
arterial walls. The plaque narrows or blocks blood
flow to the heart. Atherosclerosis is sometimes
called coronary artery disease, or CAD.
Fractionation—A laboratory test or process in
which blood or another fluid is broken down into
its components. Fractionation can be used to assess
the proportions of the different types of cholesterol
in a blood sample.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL)—A type of lipopro-
tein that protects against CAD by removing choles-
terol deposits from arteries or preventing their for-
mation.
Hypercholesterolemia—The presence of excessive-
ly high levels of cholesterol in the blood.
Lipid—Any organic compound that is greasy, insol-
uble in water, but soluble in alcohol. Fats, waxes,
and oils are examples of lipids.
Lipoprotein—A complex molecule that consists of
a protein membrane surrounding a core of lipids.
Lipoproteins carry cholesterol and other lipids from
the digestive tract to the liver and other body tis-
sues. There are five major types of lipoproteins.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)—A type of lipopro-
tein that consists of about 50% cholesterol and is
associated with an increased risk of CAD.
Plaque—An abnormal deposit of hardened choles-
terol on the wall of an artery.
Triglyceride—A chemical compound that forms
about 95% of the fats and oils stored in animal and
vegetable cells. Triglyceride levels are sometimes
measured as well as cholesterol when a patient is
screened for heart disease.
some may have a small bruise or swelling. A washcloth
soaked in warm water usually relieves any discomfort. In
addition, the patient should resume taking any prescrip-
tion medications that were discontinued before the test.

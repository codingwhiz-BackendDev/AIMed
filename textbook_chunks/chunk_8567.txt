This form of diphtheria, which is sometimes called
cutaneous diphtheria, accounts for about 33% of diphthe-
ria cases. It is found chiefly among people with poor
hygiene. Any break in the skin can become infected with
diphtheria. The infected tissue develops an ulcerated area
and a diphtheria membrane may form over the wound but
is not always present. The wound or ulcer is slow to heal
and may be numb or insensitive when touched.

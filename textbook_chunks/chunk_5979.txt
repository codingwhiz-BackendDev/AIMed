Corticosteriods are a group of natural and synthetic
analogues of the hormones secreted by the hypothalamic-
anterior pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, more com-
monly referred to as the pituitary gland. These include
glucocorticoids, which are anti-inflammatory agents with
a large number of other functions; mineralocorticoids,
which control salt and water balance primarily through
action on the kidneys; and corticotropins, which control
secretion of hormones by the pituitary gland.

While anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not
everyone will show symptoms. The first symptoms of
herpes occur within two-20 days after contact with an
infected person. Symptoms of the primary infection are
usually more severe than those of recurrent infections.
The primary infection can cause symptoms like other
viral infections including tiredness, headache, fever, and
swollen lymph nodes in the neck.
Typically, 50-80% of persons with oral herpes expe-
rience a prodrome (symptoms of oncoming disease) of
pain, burning, itching, or tingling at the site where blis-
ters will form. This prodrome stage may last anywhere
from a few hours to one to two days. The herpes infec-
tion prodrome occurs in both the primary infection and
recurrent infections.
In 95% of the patients with cold sores, the blisters
occur at the outer edge of the lips which is called the
“vermilion border.” Less often, blisters form on the nose,
chin, or cheek. Following the prodrome, the disease
process is rapid. First, small red bumps appear that
quickly form fluid-filled blisters. The painful blisters
may either burst and form a scab or dry up and form a
scab. Within two days of the first red bumps, all the blis-
ters have formed scabs. The skin heals completely and
without scarring within six to ten days.

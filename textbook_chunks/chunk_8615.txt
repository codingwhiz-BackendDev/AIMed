The disease called discoid lupus erythematosus only
affects the skin, although similar discoid skin lesions can
occur in the serious disease called systemic lupus ery-
thematosus (SLE). Only about 10% of all patients with
DLE will go on to develop the multi-organ disease SLE.
The tendency to develop DLE seems to run in fami-
lies. Although men or women of any age can develop
DLE, it occurs in women three times more frequently than
in men. The typical DLE patient is a woman in her 30s.

A two-pronged approach is taken to treat CNS infec-
tions. First, antibiotic therapy against an array of potential
infectious bacteria is begun. The second stage involves
surgery to drain the infected site. Although some CNS
infections have been resolved with antibiotics alone, the
more aggressive approach is often preferred. Surgery allows
immediate relief of pressure on the brain or spinal cord, as
well as an opportunity to collect infectious material for bac-
terial identification. Once the bacterial species is identified,
drug therapy can be altered to a more specific antibiotic.
However, surgery may not be an option in some cases, such
as when there are numerous sites of infection or when infec-
tion is located in an inaccessible area of the brain.

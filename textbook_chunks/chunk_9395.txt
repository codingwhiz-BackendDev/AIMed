No special preparation is required prior to an ear
examination with an otoscope. The ear speculum, which
is inserted into the ear, is cleaned and sanitized before it
is used. The speculums come in various sizes, and the
doctor or nurse will select the size that will be most com-
fortable for the patientâ€™s ear.

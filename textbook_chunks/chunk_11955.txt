The examiner needs to know if the patient is taking
any medications or has any existing health conditions.
Some medications, even over-the-counter (OTC) medica-
tions can affect vision or even interfere with the eyedrops
the doctor may use during the exam. Certain eyedrops
would not be used if the patient has asthma, heart prob-
lems, or other conditions.
The patient may need someone to drive them home
in case the eyes were dilated. Bringing sunglasses to the
exam may also help decrease the glare from light until
the dilating drops wear off.

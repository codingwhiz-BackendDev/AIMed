Parents should keep activated charcoal on hand in
case of emergencies.
Do not give charcoal together with syrup of ipecac.
The charcoal will adsorb the ipecac. Charcoal should be
taken 30 minutes after ipecac or after the vomiting from
ipecac stops.
Some activated charcoal products contain sorbitol.
Sorbitol is a sweetener as well as a laxative, therefore, it
may cause severe diarrhea and vomiting. These products
should not be used in infants.
Charcoal may interfere with the absorption of med-
ications and nutrients such as vitamins or minerals. For
uses other than for treatment of poisoning, charcoal
should be taken two hours after other medications.
Charcoal should not be used to treat poisoning
caused by corrosive products such as lye or other strong
acids or petroleum products such as gasoline, kerosene,
or cleaning fluids. Charcoal may make the condition
worse and delay diagnosis and treatment. In addition,
charcoal is also not effective if the poison is lithium,
cyanide, iron, ethanol, or methanol.
Parents should not mix charcoal with chocolate
syrup, sherbet, or ice cream, even though it may make
charcoal taste better. These foods may prevent charcoal
from working properly.
Activated charcoal may cause swelling or pain in the
stomach. A doctor should be notified immediately. It has
been known to cause problems in people with intestinal
bleeding, blockage or those people who have had recent
surgery. These patients should talk to their doctor before
using this product.
Charcoal may be less effective in people with slow
digestion.
Charcoal should not be given for more than three or
four days for treatment of diarrhea. Continuing for
longer periods may interfere with normal nutrition.
Charcoal should not be used in children under three
years of age to treat diarrhea or gas.
Activated charcoal should be kept out of reach of
children.

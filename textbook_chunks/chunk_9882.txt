Electrocardiography is a commonly used, non-inva-
sive procedure for recording electrical changes in the
heart. The record, which is called an electrocardiogram
(ECG or EKG), shows the series of waves that relate to
the electrical impulses which occur during each beat of
the heart. The results are printed on paper or displayed
on a monitor. The waves in a normal record are named P,
Q, R, S, and T and follow in alphabetical order. The num-
ber of waves may vary, and other waves may be present.

A woman who undergoes a c-section requires both
the care given to any new mother and the care given to
any patient recovering from major surgery. She should be
offered pain medication that does not interfere with
breastfeeding. She should be encouraged to get out of bed
and walk around eight to 24 hours after surgery to stimu-
late circulation (thus avoiding the formation of blood
clots) and bowel movement. She should limit climbing
stairs to once a day, and avoid lifting anything heavier
than the baby. She should nap as often as the baby sleeps,
and arrange for help with the housework, meals, and care
of other children. She may resume driving after two
weeks, although some doctors recommend waiting for six
weeks, the typical recovery period from major surgery.

Prevention of coagulation disorders varies. Acquired
disorders may only be prevented by preventing onset of the
underlying disorder (such as cirrhosis). Hereditary disor-
ders can be predicted with prenatal testing and genetic
counseling. Prevention of severe bleeding episodes may be
accomplished by refraining from activities that could cause
injury, such as contact sports. Open communication with
healthcare providers prior to procedures or tests that could
cause bleeding may prevent a severe bleeding incident.

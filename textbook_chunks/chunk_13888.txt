Fracture reduction is the procedure by which a frac-
tured bone is realigned in normal position. It can be
either closed or open. Closed reduction refers to realign-
ing bones without breaking the skin. It is performed with
manual manipulation and/or traction and is commonly
done with some kind of anesthetic. Open reduction pri-
marily refers to surgery that is performed to realign
bones or fragments. Fractures with little or no displace-
ment may not require any form of reduction.
Traction is used to help reposition a broken bone. It
works by applying pressure to restore proper alignment.
The traction device immobilizes the area and maintains
realignment as the bone heals. A fractured bone is immo-
bilized by applying opposing force at both ends of the
injured area, using an equal amount of traction and coun-
tertraction. Weights provide the traction pull needed or
the pull is achieved by positioning the individual’s body
weight appropriately. Traction is a form of closed reduc-
tion and is sometimes used as an alternative to surgery.
Since it restricts movement of the affected limb or body
part, it may confine a person to bed rest for an extended
period of time.
A person may need open reduction if there is an open,
severe, or comminuted fracture. This procedure allows a
physician to examine and surgically correct associated soft
tissue damage while reducing the fracture and, if neces-
sary, applying internal or external devices. Internal fixa-
tion involves the use of metallic devices inserted into or
through bone to hold the fracture in a set position and
alignment while it heals. Devices include plates, nails,
screws, and rods. When healing is complete, the surgeon
may or may not remove these devices. Virtually any hip
fracture requires open reduction and internal fixation so
that the bone will be able to support the patient’s weight.

With the appropriate knowledge and precautions,
frostbite can be prevented even in the coldest and most
challenging environments. Appropriate clothing and
footwear are essential. To prevent heat loss and keep the
blood circulating properly, clothing should be worn
loosely and in layers. Covering the hands, feet, and head
is also crucial for preventing heat loss. Outer garments
need to be wind and water resistant, and wet clothing and
footwear must be replaced as quickly as possible. Alco-
hol and drugs should be avoided because of their harmful
effects on judgment and reasoning. Experts also warn
against alcohol use and smoking in the cold because of
the circulatory changes they produce. Paying close atten-
tion to the weather report before venturing outdoors and
avoiding unnecessary risks such as driving in isolated
areas during a blizzard are also important.

The purpose of a culture-fair test is to eliminate any
social or cultural advantages, or disadvantages, that a
person may have due to their upbringing. The test can be
administered to anyone, from any nation, speaking any
language. A culture-fair test may help identify learning
or emotional problems. The duration of the test varies for
the individual types of tests available, but the time is
approximately between 12â€“18 minutes per section (a test
usually has two to four sections).
A culture-fair test is often administered by employ-
ers in order to determine the best location for new
employees in a large company. The wide variety of cul-
ture-fair tests availiable allows the administrator to
select which area is most vital, whether it be general
intelligence, knowledge of a specific area, or emotional
stability.

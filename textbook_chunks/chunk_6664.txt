This test is useful in distinguishing individuals with
excess ACTH production due to a pituitary adenoma
from those with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors.
Patients are given dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocor-
ticoid) orally every six hours for four days. Low doses of
dexamethasone are given during the first two days; for
the last two days, higher doses are administered. Before
dexamethasone is administered, as well as on each day of
the test, 24-hour urine collections are obtained.
Because cortisol and other glucocorticoids signal the
pituitary to decrease ACTH, the normal response after
taking dexamethasone is a drop in blood and urine corti-
sol levels. Thus, the cortisol response to dexamethasone
differs depending on whether the cause of Cushing’s syn-
drome is a pituitary adenoma or an ectopic ACTH-pro-
ducing tumor.
However, the dexamethasone suppression test may
produce false-positive results in patients with conditions
such as depression, alcohol abuse, high estrogen levels,
acute illness, and stress. On the other hand, drugs such as
phenytoin and phenobarbital may produce false-negative
results. Thus, patients are usually advised to stop taking
these drugs at least one week prior to the test.

Cushing’s syndrome
those with either ectopic ACTH syndrome or cortisol-
secreting adrenal tumors. In this test, patients are given
an injection of CRH, the corticotropin-releasing hor-
mone that causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH. In
patients with pituitary adenomas, blood levels of ACTH
and cortisol usually rise. However, in patients with
ectopic ACTH syndrome, this rise is rarely seen. In
patients with cortisol-secreting adrenal tumors, this rise
almost never occurs.

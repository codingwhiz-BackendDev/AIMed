Because epididymitis that affects both testicles can
make a man sterile, antibiotic therapy must be initiated
as soon as symptoms appear. To prevent reinfection,
medication must be taken exactly as prescribed, even if
the patient’s symptoms disappear or he begins to feel bet-
ter. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories can relieve
pain but should not be used without the approval of a
family physician or urologist.
Bed rest is recommended until symptoms subside,
and patients are advised to wear athletic supporters when
they resume normal activities. If pain is severe, a local
anesthetic like lidocaine (Xylocaine) may be injected
directly into the spermatic cord.
Self-care
A patient who has epididymitis should not drink
beverages that contain caffeine. To prevent constipation,
he should use stool softeners or eat plenty of fruit, nuts,
whole grain cereals, and other foods with laxative prop-
erties.
An ice bag wrapped in a towel can reduce pain and
swelling but should be removed from the inflamed area
for a few minutes every hour to prevent burns.
Strenuous activity should be avoided until symp-
toms disappear. Sexual activity should not be resumed
until a month after symptoms disappear.
If a second course of treatment doesn’t eradicate
stubborn symptoms, longterm anti-inflammatory therapy
may be recommended. In rare instances, chronic symp-
toms require surgery.

Coma lies on a spectrum with other alterations in con-
sciousness. The level of consciousness required by, for
example, someone reading this passage lies at one extreme
end of the spectrum, while complete brain death lies at the
other end of the spectrum. In between are such states as
obtundation, drowsiness, and stupor. All of these are con-
ditions which, unlike coma, still allow the individual to
respond to stimuli, although such a response may be brief
and require stimulus of greater than normal intensity.
In order to understand the loss of function suffered
by a comatose individual, it is necessary to first under-
stand the important characteristics of the conscious state.
Consciousness is defined by two fundamental elements:
awareness and arousal.
Awareness allows one to receive and process all the
information communicated by the five senses, and thus
relate to oneself and to the outside world. Awareness has
both psychological and physiological components. The
psychological component is governed by an individual’s
mind and mental processes. The physiological compo-
nent refers to the functioning of an individual’s brain,
and therefore that brain’s physical and chemical condi-
tion. Awareness is regulated by cortical areas within the
cerebral hemispheres, the outermost layer of the brain
that separates humans from other animals by allowing
for greater intellectual functioning.
Arousal is regulated solely by physiological func-
tioning and consists of more primitive responsiveness to
the world, as demonstrated by predictable reflex (invol-
untary) responses to stimuli. Arousal is maintained by
the reticular activating system (RAS). This is not an
anatomical area of the brain, but rather a network of
structures (including the brainstem, the medulla, and the
thalamus) and nerve pathways, which function together
to produce and maintain arousal.

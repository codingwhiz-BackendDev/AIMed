The causes behind depression are complex and not
yet fully understood. While an imbalance of certain neu-
rotransmitters—the chemicals in the brain that transmit
messages between nerve cell— is believed to be key to
depression, external factors such as upbringing (more so
in dysthymia than major depression) may be as impor-
tant. For example, it is speculated that, if an individual is
abused and neglected throughout childhood and adoles-
cence, a pattern of low self-esteem and negative thinking
may emerge. From that, a lifelong pattern of depression
may follow.
Heredity does seem to play a role in who develops
depressive disorders. Individuals with major depression
in their immediate family are up to three times more
likely to have the disorder themselves. It would seem
that biological and genetic factors may make certain
individuals pre-disposed or prone to depressive disor-
ders, but environmental circumstances may often trig-
ger the disorder.
External stressors and significant life changes, such
as chronic medical problems, death of a loved one,
divorce or estrangement, miscarriage, or loss of a job,
can also result in a form of depression known as adjust-
ment disorder. Although periods of adjustment disorder
usually resolve themselves, occasionally they may
evolve into a major depressive disorder.

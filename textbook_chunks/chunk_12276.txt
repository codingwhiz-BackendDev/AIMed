Most of the time, a person who faints ends up lying
on the floor. If this happens, the patient should be rolled
onto his or her back. Because someone who faints often
vomits, bystanders should keep the airway open. A per-
son who is fainting should not be held upright or in a sit-
ting position. These positions prevent blood flow to the
brain and may bring on a seizure.

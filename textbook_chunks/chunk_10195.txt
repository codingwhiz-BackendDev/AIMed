The body’s allergic reactions may include repeated
episodes of fever, shaking chills, sweating, headaches,
vomiting, and pain. Enlarged lymph nodes, swelling of
the affected area, skin ulcers, bone and joint pain, tired-
ness, and red streaks along the arm or leg also may occur.
Abscesses can form in lymph nodes or in the lymphatic
vessels. They may appear at the surface of the skin as well.
Long-term infection with lymphatic filariasis can
lead to lymphedema, hydrocele (a buildup of fluid in any
saclike cavity or duct) in the scrotum, and elephantiasis of
the legs, scrotum, arms, penis, breasts, and vulvae. The
most common site of elephantiasis is the leg. It typically
begins in the ankle and progresses to the foot and leg. At
first the swollen leg may feel soft to the touch but eventu-
ally becomes hard and thick. The skin may appear dark-
ened or warty and may even crack, allowing bacteria to
infect the leg and complicate the disease. The microfilari-
ae usually don’t cause injury. In some instances, they
cause “eosinophilia,” an increased number of eosinophils
(a type of white blood cells) in the blood.
This disease is more intense in people who never
have been exposed to lymphatic filariasis than it is in the
native people of tropical areas where the disease occurs.
This is because many of the native people often are
immunologically tolerant.

Sex-linked cutis laxa is caused by a defective gene on
the X chromosome. In addition to loose skin, its symp-
toms are mild mental retardation, loose joints, bone
abnormalities (like hooked nose, pigeon breast, and fun-
nel breast), frequent loose stools, urinary tract blockages,
and deficiencies in lysyl oxidase, an enzyme required for
the formation of properly functioning connective tissue.
(But the defective gene does not code for lysyl oxidase.)
Autosomal dominant cutis laxa is caused by a defec-
tive gene carried on an autosomal (not sex-linked) chro-
mosome. Its symptoms are loose, hanging skin, missing
elastic fibers, premature aging, and pulmonary emphy-
sema. Only a few families are known with cutis laxa
inherited as a dominant trait.
Autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 1 is caused by a
defective gene on chromosome 5. Symptoms include
emphysema; diverticula in the esophagus, duodenum,
and bladder; lax and dislocated joints; tortuous arteries;
hernias; lysyl oxidase deficiencies; and retarded growth.
Autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2 is also inherit-
ed as a recessive trait. In addition to the loose skin, this
form of the disease is characterized by bone abnormali-
ties, the delayed joining of the cranial (skull) bones, hip
dislocation, curvature of the spine, flat feet, and exces-
sive tooth decay.
Acquired cutis laxa tends to follow (and may be
caused by) severe illness characterized by fever, inflam-
mation, and a severe skin rash (erythema multiforme);
an injury to the nerves that control blood vessel dilation
and contraction; or an autoimmune condition.

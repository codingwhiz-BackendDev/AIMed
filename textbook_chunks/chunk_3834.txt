• Bronchodilators. These agents open narrowed airways
and offer significant symptomatic relief for many, but
not all, people with COPD. There are three types of
bronchodilators: Beta2 agonists, anticholinergic agents,
and theophylline and its derivatives. Depending on the
specific drug, a bronchodilator may be inhaled, inject-
ed, or taken orally.
• Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids, usually inhaled,
block inflammation and are most useful for patients
with chronic bronchitis with or without emphysema.
Steroids are generally not useful in patients who have
emphysema.
• Oxygen replacement. Eventually, patients with low
blood oxygen levels may need to rely on supplemental
oxygen from portable or stationary tanks.
• Antibiotics. Antibiotics are frequently given at the first
sign of a respiratory infection, such as increased spu-
tum production or a change in color of sputum from
clear to yellow or green.
• Vaccines. To prevent pulmonary infection from viruses
and bacteria, people with COPD should be vaccinated
against influenza each year at least six weeks before
flu season and have a one-time pneumococcal (pneu-
monia) vaccine.
• Expectorants. These agents help loosen and expel
mucus secretions from the airways.
• Diuretics. These drugs are given to prevent excess
water retention in patients with associated right heart
failure.
• Augmentation therapy (for emphysema due to AAT-
deficiency only). Replacement AAT (Prolastin), derived
from human blood which has been screened for viruses,
is injected weekly or bimonthly for life.

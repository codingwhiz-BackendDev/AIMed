Fanconi’s syndrome symptoms related directly to
impaired absorption include excessive urine production
and urination; excessive thirst; dehydration; constipa-
tion; anorexia nervosa; vomiting; elevated levels of glu-
cose, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, amino acids, and
protein (especially beta2-microglobulin and lysozyme) in
the urine; elevated levels of chloride and decreased levels
of phosphate and calcium in the blood; and excessively
acidic blood.
The most noticeable indirect consequences of
impaired reabsorption are the bone diseases, rickets and
osteomalacia. Rickets affects children and is associated
with bone deformities, failure to grow, and difficulty
walking. If a person acquires Fanconi’s syndrome as an
adult, the bone disease is termed osteomalacia and is
accompanied by severe bone pain and spontaneous frac-
tures. Unlike rickets due to malnutrition, these diseases
cannot be reversed with vitamin D. Muscle weakness and
occasional paralysis are other indirect consequences of
the ineffective reabsorption.

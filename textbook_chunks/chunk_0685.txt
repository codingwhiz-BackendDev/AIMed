A report from the European Cardiology Society in
2000 found that patients taking certain calcium chan-
nel blockers had a 27% greater risk of heart attack,
and a 26% greater risk of heart failure than patients
taking other high blood pressure medicines. However,
there are many patients affected by conditions that still
make calcium channel blockers the best choice for
them. The patient should discuss this issue with the
prescribing physician.

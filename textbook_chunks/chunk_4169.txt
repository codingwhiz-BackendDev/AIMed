Infants usually have an abnormal “gallop” heart
rhythm and may also have heart murmurs. Sometimes
excessive arterial pulses can be seen in the carotid and
suprasternal notch arteries, indicating increased pressure
in these arteries, while the femoral pulse is weak or can’t
be detected. The systolic pressure is higher in the arms
than in the legs. Enlargement of the heart can be seen in x
rays. Similar symptoms are seen in older children and
adults. A 10 mm Hg (mercury) pressure difference
between the upper and lower extremities is diagnostic for
coarctation of the aorta. For some patients, the systolic
pressure difference is observed only during exercise.
Infants frequently have an abnormal electrocardiogram
(ECG) that indicates that the right or both ventricles are
enlarged, while in older children the ECG may be normal
or show that the left ventricle is enlarged. The coarctation
may be detected in echocardiographic examination.

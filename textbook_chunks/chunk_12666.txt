Hemoccult is one type of fecal occult blood test, and
it is the most commonly used. The Hemoccult test takes
less than five minutes to perform and may be performed
in the physician’s office or in the laboratory. The Hemoc-
cult blood test can detect bleeding from the colon as low
as 0.5 mg per day.
Tests that use anti-hemoglobin antibodies (or
immunochemical tests) to detect blood in the stool are
also used. Immunochemical tests can detect up to 0.7 mg
of hemoglobin in the stool and do not require dietary
restrictions. Immunochemical tests
• are not accurate for screening for stomach cancer
• are more sensitive than Hemoccult tests in detecting
colorectal cancer
• are more expensive than Hemoccult tests
Hemoquant, another fecal occult blood test, is used
to detect as much as 500 mg/g of blood in the stool. Like
the Hemoccult, the Hemoquant test is affected by red
meat. It is not affected by chemicals in vegetables.
Fecal blood may also be measured by measuring the
chromium in the red blood cells in the feces. The stool is
collected for three to ten days. The test is used in cases
where the exact amount of the blood loss is required and
it is the only test that can exclude blood loss from the
gastrointestines with accuracy.

are given.
Ultimately, treatment almost always involves removal
of the gallbladder, a surgery called cholecystectomy.
While this is not usually recommended while the patient is
acutely ill, patients with complications usually do require
emergency surgery (immediately following diagnosis)
because the death rate increases in these cases. Similarly,
those patients who have cholecystitis with no gallstones
have about a 50% chance of death if the gallbladder is not
quickly removed. Most patients, however, do best if
surgery is performed after they have been stabilized with
fluids, an NG tube, and antibiotics as necessary. When
this is possible, gallbladder removal is done within five to
six days of diagnosis. In patients who have other serious
medical problems that may increase the risks of gallblad-
der removal surgery, the surgeon may decide to leave the
gallbladder in place. In this case, the operation may
involve removing obstructing gallstones and draining
infected bile (called cholecystotomy).
Both cholecystectomy and cholecystotomy may be
performed via the classical open abdominal operation
(laparotomy). Tiny, “keyhole” incisions, a flexible scope,
and a laser device that shatters the stones (a laparoscopic

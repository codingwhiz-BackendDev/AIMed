Cooling treatments slow chemical reactions within
the body. For this reason, cooling tissues below normal
temperature (98.6°F/37°C) can prevent injury from inad-
equate oxygen or nutrition. Cold water drowning vic-
tims suffering from hypothermia (cooling of the body
below its normal temperature) have been successfully
resuscitated after long periods underwater without med-
ical complications because of this effect. For the past 40
years, heart surgeons have been experimenting with
hypothermia to protect tissues from lack of blood circu-
lation during an operation. Neurosurgeons are also work-
ing with hypothermia to protect the very sensitive brain
tissues during periods of absent or reduced blood flow.

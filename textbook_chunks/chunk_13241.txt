The attending clinician should evaluate the injury in
a careful and systematic manner. The appearance of the
hand can provide valuable information concerning pres-
ence of fractures, vascular status, and tendon involve-
ment. Bones and joints should be evaluated for motion
and tenderness. Nerves should be examined for sensory
(feeling sensations) and motor (movement) functioning.
Amputations usually profusely bleed and there is tissue
loss. The wound is treated based on loss of tissue, bone,
and wound area. Injuries to the pulp can be obvious dur-
ing inspection. Subungal hematoma usually present a
purplish-black discoloration under the nail. This is due to
a hematoma underneath the nail. Radiographs may be
required to assess the alignment of fractures or detect
foreign bodies. Patients usually suffer from pain since
injuries to the fingertip bone are usually painful and
movement may be partially restricted due to swelling of
the affected area. Tendon injuries usually result in the
loss of ability to straighten or bend the finger.

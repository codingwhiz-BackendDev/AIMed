Anyone who has a tendency to develop folliculitis
should cleanse the skin with antibacterial soap twice a
day and before shaving and should not use oily skin
lotions. Men should not shave while the beard area is
infected. When they begin shaving again, they should use
a new blade each time. Women who have had fungal fol-
liculitis should use depilatory creams instead of razors.
Daily shampooing can help prevent folliculitis in the
scalp. The spread of infection can be prevented by not
sharing towels or washcloths

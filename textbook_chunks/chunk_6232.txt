burr holes
A craniotomy is the most commonly performed surgery for brain tumor removal.There are two basic ways to open the skull:
a curving incision from behind the hairline in front of the ear and at the nape of the neck (figure A).To reach the brain, the
surgeon uses a hand drill to make holes in the skull, pushing a soft metal guide under the bone.The bone is sawed through
until the bone flap can be removed to expose the brain (figure B). (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)

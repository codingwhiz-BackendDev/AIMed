The recommended dosage depends on the type and
strength of fluoroquinolone, and the kind of infection for
which it is being taken. Check with the physician who
prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-
scription for the correct dosage.
To make sure the infection clears up completely,
take the medicine for as long as it has been prescribed.
Do not stop taking the drug just because symptoms begin
to improve. Symptoms may return if the drug is stopped
too soon.
Fluoroquinolones work best when they are at con-
stant levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant,
take the medicine in doses spaced evenly through the day
and night. Do not miss any doses. For best results, take
this medicine with a full glass of water and drink several
more glasses throughout the day, every day during treat-
ment with the drug. The extra water will help prevent
some side effects. Some fluoroquinolones should be
taken on an empty stomach; others may be taken with
meals. Check package directions or ask the physician or
pharmacist for instructions on how to take the medicine.

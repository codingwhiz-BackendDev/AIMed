When a patient is diagnosed with congestive car-
diomyopathy, physicians try to find out the cause. If
coronary artery disease is not the culprit, in most other
cases a cause is not identified. When a condition respon-
sible for the congestive cardiomyopathy is diagnosed,
treatment is aimed at correcting the underlying condi-
tion. Congestive cardiomyopathy caused by drinking
excess alcohol or by drugs or toxins can be treated by
eliminating the alcohol or toxin completely. In some
cases, the heart may recover after the toxic substance is
removed from the body. Bacterial myocarditis is treated
with an antibiotic to eliminate the bacteria.
There is no cure for idiopathic congestive cardiomy-
opathy. Medicines are given to reduce the workload of
the heart and to relieve the symptoms.
One or more of the following types of medicines
may be prescribed for congestive cardiomyopathy:
• digitalis
• diuretics
• vasodilators
• beta blockers
• angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhib-
itors)
• angiotensin receptor blockers
Digitalis helps the heart muscle to have stronger
pumping action. Diuretics help eliminate excess salt and
water from the kidneys by making patients urinate more
often. This helps reduce the swelling caused by fluid
buildup in the tissues. Vasodilators, beta blockers, and
ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and expand the
blood vessels so blood can move more easily through
them. This action makes it easier for the heart to pump
blood through the vessels.
Patients may also be given anticoagulant medica-
tions to prevent clots from forming due to pooling of
blood in the heart chambers. Medicines to prevent abnor-
mal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) may be given, but some
of these drugs can also reduce the force of heart contrac-
tions. Automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators
(AICDs) can treat life-threatening arrhythmias, which
are relatively common in severe cardiomyopathy.

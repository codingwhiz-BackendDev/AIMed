Because a c-section is a surgical procedure, it carries
more risk to both the mother and the baby. The maternal
death rate is less than 0.02%, but that is four times the
maternal death rate associated with vaginal delivery.
However, many women have a c-section for serious med-
ical problems. The mother is at risk for increased bleeding
(because a c-section may result in twice the blood loss of
a vaginal delivery) from the two incisions, the placental
attachment site, and possible damage to a uterine artery.
Complications occur in less than 10% of cases. The moth-
er may develop infection of either incision, the urinary
tract, or the tissue lining the uterus (endometritis). Less
commonly, she may receive injury to the surrounding
organs, like the bladder and bowel. When a general anes-
thesia is used, she may experience complications from the
anesthesia. Very rarely, she may develop a wound
hematoma at the site of either incision or other blood clots
leading to pelvic thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the
major vein running from the pelvis into the leg) or a pul-
monary embolus (a blood clot lodging in the lung).

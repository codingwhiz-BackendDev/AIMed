John M. Leventhal observes, “The two prerequisites
for this form of maltreatment include sexual arousal to
children and the willingness to act on this arousal. Fac-
tors that may contribute to this willingness include alco-
hol or drug abuse, poor impulse control, and a belief that
the sexual behaviors are acceptable and not harmful to
the child.” The chances of abuse are higher if the child is
developmentally handicapped or vulnerable in some
other way.
Genital or anal injuries or abnormalities (including
the presence of sexually transmitted diseases) can be
signs of sexual abuse, but often there is no physical evi-
dence for a doctor to find. In fact, physical examinations
of children in cases of suspected sexual abuse supply
grounds for further suspicion only 15–20% of the time.
Anxiety, poor academic performance, and suicidal con-
duct are some of the behavioral signs of sexual abuse, but
are also found in children suffering other kinds of stress.
Excessive masturbation and other unusually sexualized
kinds of behavior are more closely associated with sexu-
al abuse itself.

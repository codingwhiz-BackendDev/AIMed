Because the implants are controversial, very expen-
sive, and have uncertain results, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has limited the implants to people:
• who get no significant benefit from hearing aids
• who are at least 2 years old (the age at which specialists
can verify severity of deafness)
• with severe to profound hearing loss.

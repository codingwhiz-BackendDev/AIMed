Ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of
the heart, organs, or arteries. The technician applies gel
to a hand-held transducer then presses it against the
patient’s body. The ultrasound’s sound waves arteries are
converted into an image that can be displayed on a moni-
tor. Performed in an outpatient diagnostic laboratory, the
test takes 30–60 minutes.
An arteriogram is an x ray in which a contrast medi-
um is injected to make the arteries visible on the x ray. It
can be performed in a radiology unit, outpatient clinic, or
diagnostic center of a hospital.

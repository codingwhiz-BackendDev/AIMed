The test is most often performed to find out the
cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. Abnormal bleeding
includes bleeding between menstrual periods, excessive
bleeding during a menstrual period, or bleeding after
menopause. Since abnormal uterine bleeding can indi-
cate cancer, an endometrial biopsy is done to rule out
endometrial cancer or hyperplasia (a potentially pre-
cancerous condition).
Endometrial biopsies are also done as a screening
test for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women on
hormone replacement therapy. Hormone replacement
therapy usually requires a woman to take estrogen and
progesterone. An endometrial biopsy is particularly use-
ful in cases where postmenopausal women take estrogen,
but cannot take progesterone. Estrogen in the system
without the balancing effect of progesterone has been
linked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer.
An endometrial biopsy can also be used as part of an
infertility exam to rule out problems with the develop-
ment of the endometrium. This condition is called luteal
phase defect and can cause the endometrium to not sup-
port a pregnancy. An endometrial biopsy can also be used
to evaluate the problem of repeated early miscarriages.

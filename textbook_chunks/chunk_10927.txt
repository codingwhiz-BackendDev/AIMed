If the enterostomy is temporary, aftercare consists of
the usual monitoring of surgical wounds for infection or
bleeding. If the patient has had a permanent ileostomy,
aftercare includes learning to use the appliance or empty
the Kock pouch; learning to keep the stoma clean; and
readjusting bathroom habits. Recovery takes a long time
because major surgery is a shock to the system and the
intestines take several days to resume normal function-
ing. The patientâ€™s fluid intake and output will be checked
frequently to minimize the risk of dehydration.

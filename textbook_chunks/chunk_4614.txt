red or green if they can visually compare the colors.
However, most have difficulty accurately identifying col-
ors without any other references. Most people with any
impairment in color vision learn colors, as do other
young children. These individuals often reach adoles-
cence before their visual deficiency is identified.
Color blindness is sometimes acquired. Chronic ill-
nesses that can lead to color blindness include Alzheimer’s
disease, diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, leukemia, liver dis-
ease, chronic alcoholism, macular degeneration, multi-
ple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, sickle cell anemia, and
retinitis pigmentosa. Accidents or strokes that damage the
retina or affect particular areas of the brain eye can lead to
color blindness. Some medications such as antibiotics,
barbiturates, anti-tuberculosis drugs, high blood pressure
medications, and several medications used to treat nervous
disorders and psychological problems may cause color
blindness. Industrial or environmental chemicals such as
carbon monoxide, carbon disulfide, fertilizers, styrene, and
some containing lead can cause loss of color vision. Occa-
sionally, changes can occur in the affected person’s capaci-
ty to see colors after age 60.

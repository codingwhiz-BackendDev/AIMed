The esophagus is a long, muscular tube that also has
two muscles (or sphincters) at the top and bottom. All of
these muscular areas must contract in an exact sequence
for swallowing to proceed normally. There are three
main symptoms that occur when esophageal function is
abnormal: difficulty with swallowing (dysphagia), heart-
burn, and chest pain.
Doctors perform a variety of tests to evaluate these
symptoms. Endoscopy, which is not a test of esophageal
function, is often used to determine if the lining of the
esophagus has any ulcers, tumors, or areas of narrowing
(strictures). Many times, however, endoscopy only shows
the doctor if there is injury to the esophageal lining, and
the procedure gives no information about the cause of the
problem.
Therefore, in addition to endoscopy, several studies
are available that measure esophageal function. There are
three basic types of tests used to assess esophageal func-
tion:
• Manometry is used to study the way the muscles of the
esophagus contract, and is most useful for the investi-
gation of difficulty with swallowing.
• Esophageal pH monitoring measures changes in
esophageal acidity, and is valuable for evaluating
patients with heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux dis-
ease (GERD).
• X-ray studies investigate swallowing difficulties. They
either follow the progress of barium during swallowing
using a fluoroscope, or they use radioactive scanning
techniques.

The adrenals are two glands, each of which is perched
on the upper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the
gland is known as the cortex; the inner part is known as the
medulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland is respon-
sible for producing different types of hormones. Regulation
of hormone production and release from the adrenal cortex
involves the pituitary gland, a small gland located at the
base of the brain. After the hypothalamus (the part of the
brain containing secretions important to metabolic activi-
ties) sends “releasing hormones” to the pituitary gland, the
pituitary secretes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH). The ACTH then travels through the
bloodstream to the adrenal cortex, where it encourages the
production and release of cortisol (sometimes called the
“stress” hormone) and other adrenocortical hormones.
Cortisol, a very potent glucocorticoid—a group of
adrenocortical hormones that protects the body from
stress and affect protein and carbohydrate metabolism—
is involved in regulating the functioning of nearly every
type of organ and tissue in the body, and is considered to
be one of the few hormones absolutely necessary for life.

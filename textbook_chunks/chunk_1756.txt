Patients undergoing cell therapy treatments which
use cells transplanted from animals or other humans run
the risk of cell rejection, in which the body recognizes
the cells as a foreign substance and uses the immune sys-
temâ€™s T-cells to attack and destroy them. Some forms of
cell therapy use special coatings on the cells designed to
trick the immune system into recognizing the new cells
as native to the body.
There is also the chance of the cell solution transmit-
ting bacterial or viral infection or other disease and para-
sites to the patient. Careful screening and testing of cells
for pathogens can reduce this risk.
Many forms of cell therapy in the United States are
still largely experimental procedures. Patients should
approach these treatments with extreme caution, should
inquire about their proven efficacy and legal use in the
United States, and should only accept treatment from a
licensed physician who should educate the patient com-
pletely on the risks and possible side effects involved
with cell therapy. These same cautions apply for patients
interested in participating in clinical trials of cell therapy
treatments.

fields and radio waves, can help physicians evaluate con-
genital heart disease, but is not always necessary. Physi-
cians also may use a chest x ray to look at the size and
location of the heart and lungs, or an electrocardiograph
(ECG), which measures electrical impulses to create a
graph of the heart beat.

The immediate risks after the procedure are hemor-
rhage (excessive bleeding), severe pain, and infection
(including abscesses, tetanus, and gangrene). The most
severe consequence is death due to excessive blood loss.
Long term complications include scarring, interference
with the drainage of urine and menstrual blood, chronic
urinary tract infections, pelvic and back pain, and infer-
tility. Sexual intercourse can be painful. Complications
of childbirth are also a risk. It is unclear whether it is
related to the procedure itself, or related to the general
condition of medical practice, but infant and maternal
death rates are generally higher in those communities
where female circumcision is practiced.

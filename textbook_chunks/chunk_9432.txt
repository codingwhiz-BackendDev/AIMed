Myringotomy and ear tube surgery is performed to
drain ear fluid and prevent ear infections when antibi-
otics donâ€™t work or when ear infections are chronic. The
process normalizes pressure in the middle ear and
decreases fluid accumulation. It is most commonly per-
formed on infants and children, in whom ear infections
are most frequent, and may be done on one or both ears.
The surgeon makes a small hole in the ear drum, then
uses suction to remove fluid. A small ear tube of metal or
plastic is inserted into the ear drum to allow continual
drainage. The tube prevents infections as long as it stays
in place, which varies from six months to three years.
When the tube falls out, the hole grows over. As many of
25% of children under the age of two who need ear tubes
may need them again. Myringotomy and ear tube surgery
is performed in a hospital, using a general anesthetic for
most children and a local anesthetic for older children or
adults. No anesthetic may be used for infants. The proce-
dure usually takes about two hours. Most patients can go
home the same day; children under three years of age and
those with chronic diseases usually stay overnight.

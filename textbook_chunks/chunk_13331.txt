Flesh-eating disease, which occurs very rarely, can-
not be definitively prevented. The best ways to lower the
risk of contracting flesh-eating disease are:
• take care to avoid any injury to the skin that may give
the bacteria a place of entry
• when skin injuries do occur, they should be promptly
washed and treated with an antibiotic ointment or spray
• people who have any skin injury should rigorously
attempt to avoid people who are infected with streptococ-
ci bacteria. A bacteria that causes a simple strep throat in
one person may cause flesh-eating disease in another
• have any areas of unexplained redness, pain, or
swelling examined by a doctor, particularly if the
affected area seems to be expanding

Most stones can be removed from the body by nor-
mal urination, helped by drinking large amounts of
water. Large stones that cannot be passed this way must
be removed by surgical procedures.
Large stones can be surgically removed by having a
device called a uretoscope placed into the urethra, up
through the bladder and into the ureter, where the trapped
stone can be seen and removed. Another method involves
using sound-wave energy aimed from outside the body to
break the large stone into small pieces that can be passed
by urination. This external technique is called extracor-
poreal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL).
For large stones in the kidney, a procedure called per-
cutaneous nephrolithomy may be used. In this procedure,
the surgeon makes a small incision in the back over the
kidney. An instrument called a nephroscope is inserted
through the incision into the kidney. The surgeon uses the
nephroscope to locate and remove the stone. If the stone
is very large, it may be broken up into smaller pieces by
an ultrasonic or other kind of probe before removal.

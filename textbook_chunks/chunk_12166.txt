The purpose of face lift surgery, also known as
facialplasty, rhytidoplasty, or cervicofacial rhytidectomy,
is to improve the appearance of the face by repositioning
the skin and tightening some of the underlying muscle
and tissue. The procedure is designed to counter sagging
and looseness in skin and muscle tissue caused by gravi-
ty as the patient ages. Face lift surgery will not erase all
facial wrinkles, as the term rhytidectomy (which literally
means “surgical removal of wrinkles”) might imply.
Wrinkles around the mouth and eyes, for example, may
benefit little from face lift surgery. Other procedures,
such as blepharoplasty, chemical peel, or dermabrasion,
also may be necessary.

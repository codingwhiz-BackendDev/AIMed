Viruses are generally divided into those that use
DNA (desoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA as their genetic
material; all enteroviruses are RNA viruses. They are
found worldwide, but infection is more common in areas
of poor hygiene and overcrowding.
Although most cases of enterovirus do not produce
symptoms, some five to 10 million individuals in the Unit-
ed States each year suffer from one of the enteroviral dis-
eases. Illness is more common in the very young. While
there are close to seventy different strains of enteroviruses,
over 70% of infections are caused by only 10 types.
The virus is most commonly transmitted by the
fecal-oral route (contamination of fingers or objects by
human waste material); in some instances transmission is
through contaminated food or water. Passage of some
strains of virus by way of air droplets can lead to respira-
tory illness. Infection of fetuses by way of the placenta
has also been documented. Breast milk contains antibod-
ies which can protect newborns.
The incubation period for most enteroviruses ranges
from two to 14 days. In areas of temperate climate, infec-
tions occur mainly in the summer and fall.

Blood leaves the heart by way of the left ventricle
and is distributed to the body by arteries. The aortic arch
is the first artery to carry blood as it leaves the heart.
Other arteries to the head and arms branch off the aortic
arch. A narrowing of the aorta at any spot produces resis-
tance to the flow of blood. This causes high blood pres-
sure before the narrowing and low pressure below the nar-
rowing (downstream). Parts of the body supplied by arter-
ies that branch off the aortic arch before the narrowing
have high blood pressure, while most of the lower body
doesnâ€™t receive enough blood supply. To compensate for
this, the heart works harder, and the blood pressure rises.
Approximately half of all infants with coarctation of
the aorta are diagnosed within the first two months of
life. Frequently, there are other congenital cardiac com-
plications present. Infants with Turner syndrome have a
45% rate of also having coarctation. There is evidence
that some cases of coarctation may be inherited.

As of 2001, the two leading causes of death for both
men and women in the United States were heart disease
and cancer. Accidental death was a distant third fol-
lowed by such problems as stroke, chronic lung disor-
ders, pneumonia, suicide, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus,
and murder. The order of these causes of death varies
among persons of different age, ethnicity, and gender.

The best form of cholera prevention is to establish
good sanitation and waste treatment systems. In the
absence of adequate sewage treatment, the following
guidelines should be followed to reduce the possibility of
infection:
• Boil it. Drink and brush teeth only with water that has
been boiled or treated with chlorine or iodine tablets. Safe
drinks include coffee and tea made with boiling water or
carbonated bottled water and carbonated soft drinks.
• Cook it. Eat only thoroughly cooked foods, and eat
them while they are still hot. Avoid eating food from
street vendors.
• Peel it. Eat only fruit or nuts with a thick, intact skin or
shell that is removed immediately before eating.
• Forget it. Do not eat raw foods such as oysters or
ceviche. Avoid salads and raw vegetables. Do not use
untreated ice cubes in otherwise safe drinks.
• Stay out of it. Do not swim or fish in polluted water.
A cholera vaccine exists that can be given to travel-
ers and residents of areas where cholera is known to be
active, but the vaccine is not highly effective. It provides
only 25–50% immunity, and then only for a period of
about six months. The vaccine is never given to infants
under six months of age. The United States Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention do not currently recom-
mend cholera vaccination for travelers. Residents of
cholera-plagued areas should discuss the value of the
vaccine with their doctor.

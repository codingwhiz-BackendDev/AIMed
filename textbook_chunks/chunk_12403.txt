Family systems theory maintains that emotional rela-
tionships in families are usually triangular. Whenever any
two persons in the family system have problems with each
other, they will “triangle in” a third member as a way of sta-
bilizing their own relationship. The triangles in a family sys-
tem usually interlock in a way that maintains family home-
ostasis. Common family triangles include a child and its
parents; two children and one parent; a parent, a child, and a
grandparent; three siblings; or, husband, wife, and an in-law.

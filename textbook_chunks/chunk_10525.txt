If endometrial cancer is suspected, a series of tests
will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. The first
step will involve taking a complete personal and family
medical history. A physical examination, which will
include a thorough pelvic examination, will also be
done.
The doctor may order an endometrial biopsy. This
is generally performed in the doctorâ€™s office and does not
require anesthesia. A thin, flexible tube is inserted
through the cervix and into the uterus. A small piece of
endometrial tissue is removed. The patient may experi-
ence some discomfort, which can be minimized by tak-
ing an anti-inflammatory medication (like Advil or
Motrin) an hour before the procedure.
If an adequate amount of tissue was not obtained by
the endometrial biopsy, or if the biopsy tissue looks
abnormal but confirmation is needed, the doctor may per-
form a dilatation and curettage (D & C). This procedure
is done in the outpatient surgery department of a hospital

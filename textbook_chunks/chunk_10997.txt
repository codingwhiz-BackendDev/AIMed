In traditional medicine, enzyme supplements are
often prescribed for patients suffering from disorders
that affect the digestive process, such as cystic
fibrosis, Gaucher’s disease, and celiac disease. A pro-
gram of enzyme supplementation is rarely recommend-
ed for healthy patients. However, proponents of
enzyme therapy believe that such a program is benefi-
cial for everyone. They point to enzymes’ ability to
purify the blood, strengthen the immune system,
enhance mental capacity, cleanse the colon, and main-
tain proper pH balance in urine. They feel that by
improving the digestive process, the body is better able
to combat infection and disease.
Some evidence exists that pancreatic enzymes
derived from animal sources are helpful in cancer treat-
ment. The enzymes may be able to dissolve the coating
on cancer cells and may make it easier for the immune
system to attack the cancer.

illnesses that can be treated by enzyme therapy includes:

In debridement, dead tissue is removed so that the
remaining living tissue can adequately heal. Dead tissue
exposed to the air will form a hard black crust, called an
eschar. Deeper tissue will remain moist and may appear
white, or yellow and soft, or flimsy. The four major
debridement techniques are surgical, mechanical, chemi-
cal, and autolytic.

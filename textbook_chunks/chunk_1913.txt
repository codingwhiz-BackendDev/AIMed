As in most neurologic diseases, diagnosis is made
most often from the patient’s history, with careful inquiry
into family history and the patient’s onset and pattern of
symptoms, as well as neurologic examination. Brain
computed tomography scan (CT) or magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) may identify lobar hemorrhage,
stroke, or petechial hemorrhages, and are important in
excluding arteriovenous malformation, brain tumor, or
other causes of hemorrhage. Angiography (x-ray study
of the interior of blood vessels and the heart) is not help-
ful in diagnosis of CAA, but may be needed to exclude
aneurysm. Brain biopsy (surgical removal of a small
piece of brain tissue) may show characteristic amyloid
deposits, but is rarely performed, as the risk may not be
justifiable in the absence of effective treatment for CAA.
If diagnosis is uncertain, biopsy may be needed to rule
out conditions which are potentially treatable. Definite
diagnosis requires microscopic examination of brain tis-
sue, either at biopsy, at autopsy, or at surgery when brain
hemorrhage is drained. Lumbar puncture to examine
cerebrospinal fluid proteins may show characteristic
abnormalities, but is not part of the routine exam. In
familial forms, genetic analysis may be helpful.
CAA with hemorrhage must be distinguished from
other types of brain hemorrhage. In CAA, hemorrhage
typically occurs in the lobar region, often ruptures into the
subarachnoid space between the brain and its coverings,
and occurs at night. In hemorrhage related to high blood
pressure, hemorrhage is usually deeper within the brain,
ruptures into the ventricles or cavities deep inside the
brain, and occurs during daytime activities. Other causes
of brain hemorrhage are arteriovenous malformations,
trauma, aneurysms, bleeding into a brain tumor, vasculi-
tis (inflammation of blood vessels), or bleeding disorders.

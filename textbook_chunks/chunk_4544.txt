and in some cases, completely obstructing normal elimi-
nation of waste matter from the body. It is quite common
for people to only have one bowel movement per day,
and some as few as one or two per week.
Alternative practitioners advise that we probably
should have one bowel movement for every meal that we
eat. If not, then we are not eliminating wastes complete-
ly, and if input exceeds output, then we will surely suffer
the consequences at some point.
Incomplete elimination of body wastes may result in
the following, depending on where the deposits end up:
• sluggish system
• joint pain and arthritis
• irritable bowel syndrome
• diverticulitis
• Crohn’s disease
• leaky gut syndrome
• heart problem
• migraine
• allergies
• bad breath
• acne and other skin problems such as psoriasis
• asthma
• early senility and Alzheimer’s disease
• chronic fatigue syndrome
• cancer, particularly of the bowel
• multiple sclerosis
During colonic irrigation, a small speculum is
passed into the patient’s bowel through the rectum. This
is attached to a tube, which leads to a machine that
pumps temperature-controlled water into the colon at a
controlled rate (to be controlled by either the practitioner
or the patient). The temperature of the water should ide-
ally be kept as close to body temperature as possible.
The patient will temporarily be filled with water up
to the level of the entire colon. Patients say they can feel
the water up under their ribs but that the process,
although sometimes uncomfortable, is not painful. The
amount of water will vary but will generally be in the
region of between two and six liters (or quarts) at any
one time. This triggers peristaltic action and the patient
will begin to expel the water along with fecal matter back
through the tube and into the machine.
The fecal matter is flushed out through a viewing
tube, so that what is eliminated may be monitored. Quite
often, unsuspected parasites are expelled, along with
very old fecal material, very dark in color, which may

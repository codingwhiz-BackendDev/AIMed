Manometry is used to diagnose abnormalities relat-
ed to contraction or relaxation of the various muscular
regions of the esophagus. These studies cannot distin-
guish whether injury to either the muscle or nerves of the
esophagus is producing the abnormal results. Only the
final effect on esophageal muscle is identified. Results
should be interpreted in light of the patientâ€™s entire med-
ical history.
For example, there are many diseases that cause
poor relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. When
no cause is found, the disease is called achalasia.
Abnormal results of pH tests can confirm symptoms
of heartburn or indicate a cause of chest pain (or rarely,
swallowing difficulties). Doctors may want to start or
change medications based on these results, or even repeat
the test using different doses of medication. As noted
above, these studies are indicated before surgical treat-
ment of GERD.
X-ray tests can only serve to document an abnormal-
ity, and they are far from perfect. If they are negative,
then other studies are often needed.

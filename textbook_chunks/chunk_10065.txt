calcium is referred to as bound calcium. The normal range
of free calcium is 4.8–5.2 mg/dL. The normal concentra-
tion of serum magnesium is in the range of 2.0–3.0 mg/dL.
The normal concentration range of chloride is
350–375 mg/dL or 98–106 mM. The normal level of
phosphate, as expressed as the concentration of phospho-
rus, is 2.0–4.3 mg/dL. Bicarbonate is an electrolyte that
is freely and spontaneously interconvertable with carbon-
ic acid and carbon dioxide. The normal concentration of
carbonic acid (H2CO3) is about 1.35 mM. The normal
concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3
) is about 27 mM.
The concentration of total carbon dioxide is the sum of
carbonic acid and bicarbonate; this sum is normally in
the range of 26–28 mM. The ratio of bicarbonate/carbon-
ic acid is more significant than the actual concentrations
of these two forms of carbon dioxide. Its normal value is
27/1.35 (equivalent to 20/1).

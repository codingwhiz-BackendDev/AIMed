Certain cancer drugs reduce the body’s ability to
fight infections. Although colony stimulating factors help
restore the body’s natural defenses, the process takes
time. Getting prompt treatment for infections is impor-
tant, even while taking this medicine. Call the physician
at the first sign of illness or infection, such as a sore
throat, fever or chills.
Seeing a physician regularly while taking this medi-
cine is important. This will give the physician a chance to
make sure the medicine is working and to check for
unwanted side effects.
People with certain medical conditions may have
problems if they take colony stimulating factors. In peo-
ple who have kidney disease, liver disease, or conditions
caused by inflammation or immune system problems,
colony stimulating factors may make these problems
worse. People with heart disease may be more likely to
have side effects such as water retention and heart
rhythm problems when they take these drugs. And people
with lung disease may be more likely to have shortness
of breath. Anyone who has any of these medical condi-
tions should check with his or her physician before using
colony stimulating factors.

There are blood tests that determine the activity of the
complement system. The two most common screening
tests, CH50 and APH50, tell the physician which group of
complement components have a defect. More specific
blood tests for the individual complement components
(e.g., C3 or C4 complement) are then performed. Other
specialized blood tests, including C1 esterase level, Ham
test, and a white blood count, may also be performed.

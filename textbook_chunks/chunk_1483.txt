Certain common-sense precautions can be taken to
guard against the disease. Scratches and bites should be
washed immediately with soap and water, and it is never
a good idea to rub one’s eyes after handling a cat without
first washing one’s hands. Children should be told not to
play with stray cats or make cats angry. Immunocompro-
mised people should avoid owning kittens, which are
more likely than adult cats to be infectious. Because cat-
scratch disease is usually not a life-threatening illness
and people tend to form strong emotional bonds with
their cats, doctors do not recommend getting rid of a cat
suspected of carrying the disease.

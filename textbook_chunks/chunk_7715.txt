Soft tissue injuries, such as a “fat lip,” a burned
tongue, or a cut inside the cheek, are characterized by
pain, redness, and swelling with or without bleeding. A
broken tooth often has a sharp edge that may cut the
tongue and cheek. Depending on the position of the frac-
ture, the tooth may or may not cause toothache pain.
When a tooth is knocked out (evulsed), the socket is
swollen, painful, and bloody. A jawbone may be broken
if the upper and lower teeth no longer fit together proper-
ly (malocclusion), or if the jaws have pain with limited
ability to open and close (mobility), especially around
the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).

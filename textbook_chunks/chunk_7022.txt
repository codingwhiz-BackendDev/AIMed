When cystitis is suspected, the doctor will first
examine the patientâ€™s abdomen and lower back, to evalu-
ate unusual enlargements of the kidneys or swelling of
the bladder. In small children, the doctor will check for
fever, abdominal masses, and a swollen bladder.
The next step in diagnosis is collection of a urine
sample. The procedure differs somewhat for women and
men. Laboratory testing of urine samples can now be
performed with dipsticks that indicate immune system
responses to infection, as well as with microscopic
analysis of samples. Normal human urine is sterile. The

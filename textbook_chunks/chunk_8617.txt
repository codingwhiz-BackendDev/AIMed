Causes and symptoms
The cause of DLE is unknown. It is thought that
DLE (like SLE) may be an autoimmune disorder.
Autoimmune disorders are those that occur when cells
of the immune system are misdirected against the body.
Normally, immune cells work to recognize and help
destroy foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
In autoimmune disorders, these cells mistakenly recog-
nize various tissues of the body as foreign invaders, and
attack and destroy these tissues. In SLE, the misdirected
immune cells are antibodies. In DLE, the damaging cells
are believed to be a type of white blood cell called a T
lymphocyte. The injury to the skin results in inflamma-
tion and the characteristic discoid lesions.
In DLE, the characteristic skin lesion is circular and
raised. The reddish rash is about 5–10 mm in diameter,
with the center often somewhat scaly and lighter in color
than the darker outer ring. The surface of these lesions is
sometimes described as “warty.” There is rarely any itch-
ing or pain associated with discoid lesions. They tend to
appear on the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, back, and
arms. As DLE lesions heal, they leave thickened, scarred
areas of skin. When the scalp is severely affected, there
may be associated hair loss (alopecia).
People with DLE tend to be quite sensitive to the
sun. They are more likely to get a sunburn, and the sun
is likely to worsen their discoid lesions.

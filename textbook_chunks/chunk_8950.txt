is directed at addressing the individual con-
cerns of a particular patient. For example, heart defects
will many times require surgical repair, as will duodenal
atresia. Many Down syndrome patients will need to wear
glasses to correct vision. Patients with hearing impair-
ment benefit from hearing aids.
A new drug, referred to as a “smart drug,” has been
receiving some attention in the treatment of Down syn-
drome patients. This drug, piracetam, has not been
proven to increase intellectual ability, despite testimoni-
als that have been receiving attention on television and
the Internet. Piracetam has not been approved for use in
the United States, although it is being sold via the Inter-
net. The National Down Syndrome Society and the
National Down Syndrome Congress do not recommend
the use of this drug as of 2001.
While some decades ago, all Down syndrome chil-
dren were quickly placed into institutions for lifelong
care. Research shows very clearly that the best outlook
for children with Down syndrome is a normal family life
in their own home. This requires careful support and edu-
cation of the parents and the siblings. It is a life-changing
event to learn that a new baby has a permanent condition
that will effect essentially all aspects of his or her devel-
opment. Some community groups exist to help families
deal with the emotional effects of this new information,
and to help plan for the baby’s future. Schools are
required to provide services for children with Down syn-
drome, sometimes in separate special education class-
rooms, and sometimes in regular classrooms (this is
called mainstreaming or inclusion).

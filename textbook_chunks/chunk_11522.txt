Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves intravenously
injecting a drug that is absorbed by cancer cells and kills
them after they are exposed to specific laser beams. PDT
can be used for palliation, but it also cured some early
esophageal 
cancers 
during 
preliminary 
studies.
Researchers are comparing its benefits with those of
more established therapies.
Endoscopic laser therapy involves delivering short,
powerful laser treatments to the tumor through an endo-
scope. It can improve dysphagia, but multiple treatments
are required, and the benefit is seldom long-lasting.

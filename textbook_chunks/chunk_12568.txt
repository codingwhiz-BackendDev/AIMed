medicine, wrap their patients in colored cloth chosen for
its therapeutic hue. Individuals suffering from fatigue
would be wrapped in reds and oranges chosen for their
uplifting and energizing properties. Patients may also be
bathed in light from a color filtered light source to
enhance the healing effects of the treatment.
Individuals may also be treated with color-infused
water. This is achieved by placing translucent red colored
paper or colored plastic wrap over and around a glass of
water and placing the glass in direct sunlight so the water
can soak up the healing properties and vibrations of the
color. Environmental color sources may also be used to
promote feelings of stimulation and energy. Red wall and
window treatments, furniture, clothing, and even food may
be recommended for their energizing healing properties.
Color therapy can be used in conjunction with both
hydrotherapy and aromatherapy to heighten the thera-
peutic effect. Spas and holistic healthcare providers may
recommend red color baths or soaks, which combine the
benefits of a warm or hot water soak with energizing
essential oils and the fatigue-fighting effects of bright red
hues used in color therapy.

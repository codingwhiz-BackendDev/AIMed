Balloon angioplasty and coronary stenting are per-
formed to relieve the symptoms of coronary artery disease.
By the time coronary artery disease progresses and
requires balloon angioplasty, there is no alternative to bal-
loon angioplasty other than coronary bypass surgery.
Coronary bypass surgery carries greater risks. However,
since coronary artery disease can be related to high fat
diets, smoking, and lack of exercise, changes in lifestyle
may reduce the risk of developing the disease. Various
medications for cholesterol, high blood pressure, and dia-
betes also can help treat or prevent coronary artery disease.

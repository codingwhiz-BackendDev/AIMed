This disorder is a deficiency in prothrombin, or Factor
II, a glycoprotein formed and stored in the liver. Prothrom-
bin, under the right conditions, is converted to thrombin,
which activates fibrin and begins the process of coagula-
tion. Some patients may show no symptoms, and others
will suffer severe hemorrhaging. Patients may experience
easy bruising, profuse nosebleeds, postpartum hemorrhage,
excessively prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, and
postsurgical hemorrhage. Hypoprothrombinemia may also
be acquired rather than inherited, and usually results from a
Vitamin K deficiency caused by liver diseases, newborn
hemorrhagic disease, or a number of other factors.

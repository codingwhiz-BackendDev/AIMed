The surgery is done under general anaesthesia,
which puts the patient to sleep and affects the whole
body. Operating on the patient’s back, the neurosurgeon
or orthopedic surgeon makes an opening into the verte-
bral canal, and then moves the dura and the bundle of
nerves called the “cauda equina” (horse’s tail) aside,
which exposes the disk. If a portion of the disk has
moved from between the vertebrae out into the nerve
canal, it is simply removed. If the disk itself has become
fragmented and partially displaced, or not fragmented
but bulging extensively, the surgeon will remove the
bulging or displaced part of the disk and the part that lies
in the space between the vertebrae.

The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer area of
the eye. It lies in front of the colored part of the eye (iris)
and the black hole in the iris (pupil). The outermost layer
of the eyeball consists of the cornea and the white part of
the eye (sclera). A corneal abrasion is basically a superfi-
cial cut or scrape on the cornea. A corneal abrasion is not
as serious as a corneal ulcer, which is generally deeper
and more severe than an abrasion.

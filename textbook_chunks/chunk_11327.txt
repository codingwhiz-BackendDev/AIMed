In many cases of blood type incompatibility, the
symptoms of erythroblastosis fetalis are prevented with
careful monitoring and blood type screening. Treatment
of minor symptoms is typically successful and the baby
will not suffer long-term problems.
Nevertheless, erythroblastosis is a very serious con-
dition for approximately 4,000 babies annually. In about
15% of cases, the baby is severely affected and dies
before birth. Babies who survive pregnancy may develop
kernicterus, which can lead to deafness, speech prob-
lems, cerebral palsy, or mental retardation. Extended
hydrops fetalis can inhibit lung growth and contribute to
heart failure. These serious complications are life
threatening, but with good medical treatment, the fatality
rate is very low. According to the U.S. Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, there were 21 infant deaths
in the United States during 1996 that were attributable to
hemolytic disease (erythroblastosis fetalis) and jaundice.

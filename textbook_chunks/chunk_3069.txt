Many people besides the Palmers have contributed
to the development of chiropractic theory and technique.
Some have gone on to create a variety of procedures and
related types of therapy that have their roots in chiroprac-
tic, including McTimoney-Corley chiropractic, cran-
iosacral manipulation, naprapathy, and applied kinesiol-
ogy. Osteopathy is another related holistic discipline
that utilizes spinal and musculoskeletal manipulation as a
part of treatment, but osteopathic training is more similar
in scope to that of an M.D.

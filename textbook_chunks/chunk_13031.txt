The cause of breast fibroadenomas is unknown.
They may be dependent upon estrogen, because they are
common in premenopausal women, can be found in post-
menopausal women taking estrogen, and because they
grow larger in pregnant women.
Fibroadenomas usually cause no symptoms and may
be discovered during breast self-examination, or during
a routine check-up.

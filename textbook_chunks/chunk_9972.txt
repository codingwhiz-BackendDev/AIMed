Full instructions should be given to EEG patients
when they schedule their test. Typically, individuals on
medications that affect the central nervous system, such
as anticonvulsants, stimulants, or antidepressants, are
told to discontinue their prescription for a short time
prior to the test (usually one to two days). Patients may
be asked to avoid food and beverages that contain caf-
feine, a central nervous system stimulant. However, any
such request should be cleared by the treating physician.
Patients may also be asked to arrive for the test with
clean hair free of spray or other styling products.
Patients undergoing a sleep EEG may be asked to
remain awake the night before their test. They may be
given a sedative prior to the test to induce sleep.

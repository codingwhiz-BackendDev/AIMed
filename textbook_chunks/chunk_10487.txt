The test is performed by a doctor who specializes in
women’s reproductive health (an obstetrician/gynecolo-
gist). The test is performed either in the doctor’s office or
in a local hospital. The patient may be asked to take pain
medication (like Motrin or Aleve) an hour or so before
the procedure. A local anesthetic may be injected into the
cervix in order to decrease pain and discomfort during
the procedure.
The woman will be asked to lie on her back with
knees apart and feet in stirrups. The doctor will first con-
duct a thorough exam of the pelvic region, including the
vulva (the external genitals), vagina, and uterus. A specu-
lum (an instrument that is used to hold the walls of the
vagina open) will be inserted into the vagina. A small,
hollow plastic tube is then passed into the uterine cavity.
A small piece of the uterine lining is sucked out with a
plunger that is attached to the tube. Once the sample is
obtained, the instruments are removed. The sample is
sent to the laboratory for microscopic examination.
The patient may experience some pain when the
cervix is grasped. The patient may also feel some cramp-
ing, pressure, and discomfort when the instruments are
inserted into the uterus and the tissue sample is collected.

• By mouth (oral)—Birth control pills must be taken by
mouth every day.
• Injected—Depo Provera is a hormonal medication that
is given by injection every three months.
• Implanted—Norplant is a long-acting hormonal form
of birth control that is implanted under the skin of the
upper arm.
• Vaginal—Spermicides and barrier methods work in the
vagina.
• Intra-uterine—The IUD is inserted into the uterus.
• Surgical—Tubal sterilization is a form of surgery. A
doctor must perform the procedure in a hospital or sur-
gical clinic. Many women need general anesthesia.
The methods of birth control differ from each other
in the timing of when they are used. Some methods of
birth control must be used specifically at the time of sex-
ual intercourse (condoms, diaphragm, cervical cap, sper-
micides). All other methods of birth control must be
working all the time to provide protection (hormonal
methods, IUDs, tubal sterilization).

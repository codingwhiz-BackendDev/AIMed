Some allopathic practitioners claim that colonic irri-
gation flushes out essential electrolytes and friendly bac-
teria from the bowel and that it can be dangerous. Practi-
tioners counter that this can easily be remedied with the
use of probiotics, and that in any case, these possible dis-
advantages are easily offset by the benefits of having
large amounts of putrefying matter, harmful organisms,
and parasites removed from the system.

Dissociative amnesia is a disorder in which the
distinctive feature is the patientâ€™s inability to remem-
ber important personal information to a degree that
cannot be explained by normal forgetfulness. In many
cases, it is a reaction to a traumatic accident or wit-
nessing a violent crime. Patients with dissociative
amnesia may develop depersonalization or trance
states as part of the disorder, but they do not experi-
ence a change in identity.

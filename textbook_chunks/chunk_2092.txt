In most cases, impacted cerumen is successfully
removed by irrigation with no lasting side effects. Irriga-
tion can, however, lead to infection of the outer or the
middle ear if the patient has a damaged or absent ear
drum. Patients who try to remove earwax themselves
with hair pins or similar objects run the risk of perforat-
ing the ear drum or damaging the fragile skin covering
the ear canal, causing bleeding and the risk of infection.

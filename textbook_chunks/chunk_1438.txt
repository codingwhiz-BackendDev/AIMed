The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is made in
part by checking to see whether the patientâ€™s symptoms
can be brought on by holding his or her hand in position
with wrist bent for about a minute. Wrist x rays are often
taken to rule out the possibility of a tumor causing pres-
sure on the median nerve. A physician examining a patient
suspected of having carpal tunnel syndrome will perform a
variety of simple tests to measure muscle strength and sen-
sation in the affected hand and arm. Further testing might
include electromyographic or nerve conduction velocity
testing to determine the exact severity of nerve damage.
These tests involve stimulating the median nerve with
electricity and measuring the resulting speed and strength
of the muscle response, as well as recording speed of
nerve transmission across the carpel tunnel.

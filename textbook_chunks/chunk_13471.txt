These infections are caused by Clonorchis sinensis,
the Chinese liver fluke, and Opisthorchis viverrini or O.
felineus. The diseases are widespread, affecting more
than 20 million people in Japan, China, Southeast Asia,
and India. The life cycle of these liver flukes is similar to
that of F. hepatica except that the etacercariae are encyst-
ed in freshwater fish rather than on plants. Dogs, cats,
and other mammals that eat raw fish can be infected with
opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis.

Because so many different factors influence blood
drug levels, the following points should be taken into
consideration during TDM: the age and weight of the
patient; the route of administration of the drug; the drug’s
absorption rate, excretion rate, delivery rate, and dosage;
other medications the patient is taking; other diseases the
patient has; the patient’s compliance regarding the drug
treatment regimen; and the laboratory methods used to
test for the drug.

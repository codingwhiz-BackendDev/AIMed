It is important for people who receive chelation ther-
apy to work with medical personnel who are experienced
in the use of this treatment. Treatment should not be
undertaken before a good physical, lifestyle evaluation,
history, and any laboratory tests necessary are per-
formed. The staff must be forthcoming about test results
and should answer any questions the patient may have.
Evaluation and treatment should be individualized and
involve assessment of kidney function before each treat-
ment with chelation, since the metals bound by the
EDTA are excreted through the kidneys.
Although EDTA binds harmful, toxic metals like
mercury, lead, and cadmium, it also binds some essential
nutrients of the body, such as copper, iron, calcium, zinc,
and magnesium. Large amounts of zinc are lost during
chelation. Zinc deficiency can cause impaired immune
function and other harmful effects. Supplements of zinc
are generally given to patients undergoing chelation, but
it is not known whether this is adequate to prevent defi-
ciency. Also, chelation therapy does not replace proper
nutrition, exercise, and appropriate medications or
surgery for specific diseases or conditions.

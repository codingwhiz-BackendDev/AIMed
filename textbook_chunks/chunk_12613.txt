people fecal incontinence is a relatively minor problem,
as when it is limited to a slight occasional soiling of
underwear, but for other people it involves a considerable
loss of bowel control and has a devastating effect on
quality of life and psychological well-being. Fortunately,
professional medical treatment is usually able to restore
bowel control or at least substantially reduce the severity
of the condition.

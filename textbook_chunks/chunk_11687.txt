pas-
sive, active, and active assists. Passive range of motion is
movement applied to a joint solely by another person or
persons or a passive motion machine. When passive
range of motion is applied, the joint of an individual
receiving exercise is completely relaxed while the out-
side force moves the body part, such as a leg or arm,
throughout the available range. Injury, surgery, or immo-
bilization of a joint may affect the normal joint range of
motion. Active range of motion is movement of a joint
provided entirely by the individual performing the exer-
cise. In this case, there is no outside force aiding in the
movement. Active assist range of motion is described as
a joint receiving partial assistance from an outside force.
This range of motion may result from the majority of
motion applied by an exerciser or by the person or per-
sons assisting the individual. It may also be a half-and-
half effort on the joint from each source.

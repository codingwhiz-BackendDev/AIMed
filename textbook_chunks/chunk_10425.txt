Carotid arteries—The four principal arteries of the
neck and head. There are two common carotid
arteries, each of which divides into the two main
branches (internal and external).
Diabetes mellitus—A disorder in which the pan-
creas doesn’t produce enough (or any) insulin. As
a result, the blood levels of sugar become very
high. Among other things, diabetes can lead to the
breakdown of small blood vessels and a high risk
of atherosclerosis and high blood pressure.
Stroke—Damage to the part of the brain caused
by an interruption of the blood supply. In some
cases, small pieces of plaque in the carotid artery
may break loose and block an artery in the brain.
A narrowed carotid artery also can be the source
of blood clots travelling to the brain, or the artery
can become completely clogged, blocking all
blood flow to the brain.
buildup of fat and cholesterol usually affects all arteries,
not just the one that was operated on. Affected arteries in
other parts of the body may be equally clogged and poten-
tially dangerous. Even arteries that were operated elec-
tively will likely, begin to clog up again after the surgery.
For this reason, lifestyle changes (no smoking, low
fat, low cholesterol diet) are important, especially if diet
and lifestyle contributed to the development of the prob-
lem in the first place.

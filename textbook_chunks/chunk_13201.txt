Either ivermectin, albendazole, or diethylcarba-
mazine is used to treat a filariasis infection by eliminat-
ing the larvae, impairing the adult wormsâ€™ ability to
reproduce, and by actually killing adult worms. Unfortu-
nately, much of the tissue damage may not be reversible.
The medication is started at low doses to prevent reac-
tions caused by large numbers of dying parasites.
While effective, the medications can cause severe
side effects in up to 70% of patients as a result either of
the drug itself or the massive death of parasites in the
blood. Diethylcarbamazine, for example, can cause
severe allergic reactions and the formation of pus-filled
sores (abscesses). These side effects can be controlled
using antihistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs (cor-
ticosteroids). Rarely, treatment with diethylcarbamazine
in someone with very high levels of parasite infection
may lead to a fatal inflammation of the brain (encephali-
tis). In this case, the fever is followed by headache and
confusion, then stupor and coma caused when massive
numbers of larvae and parasites die. Other common drug
reactions include dizziness, weakness, and nausea.

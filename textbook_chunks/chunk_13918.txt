mutation. People who carry a premutation do not usually
have symptoms of fragile X syndrome; although there
have been reports of individuals with a premutation and
subtle intellectual or behavioral symptoms. Individuals
who carry a fragile X premutation are at risk to have chil-
dren or grandchildren with the condition. Female premu-
tation carriers may also be at increased risk for earlier
onset of menopause; however, premutation carriers may
exist through several generations of a family and no
symptoms of fragile X syndrome will appear.
The size of the premutation can expand over suc-
ceeding generations. Once the size of the premutation
exceeds 230 repeats, it becomes a full mutation and the
FMR-1 gene is disabled. Individuals who carry the full
mutation may have fragile X syndrome. Since the FMR-
1 gene is located on the X chromosome, males are more
likely to develop symptoms than females. This is because
males have only one copy of the X chromosome. Males
who inherit the full mutation are expected to have mental
impairment. A femaleâ€™s normal X chromosome may
compensate for her chromosome with the fragile X gene
mutation. Females who inherit the full mutation have an
approximately 50% risk of mental impairment. The phe-
nomenon of an expanding trinucleotide repeat in succes-
sive generations is called anticipation. Another unique

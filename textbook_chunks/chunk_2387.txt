When a person is infected with Chagas’ disease, the
parasite known as Trypanosoma cruzi first causes a mild,
short-lived period of “acute” illness; then after a long
period without symptoms, the effects of the infection
begin to appear. The heart, esophagus, and colon are
most frequently involved. These organs become unable
to contract properly, and begin to stretch or dilate.

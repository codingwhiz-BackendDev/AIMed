Following a diagnosis of cervical cancer, the physi-
cian takes a medical history and performs a complete
physical examination. This includes an evaluation of
symptoms and risk factors for cervical cancer. The lymph
nodes are examined for evidence that the cancer has
spread from the cervix. The choice of treatment depends
on the clinical stage of the disease.

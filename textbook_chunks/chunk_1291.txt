Fluid can collect inside the pericardium and com-
press the heart when the kidneys do not properly remove
waste from the blood, when the pericardium swells from
unknown causes, from infection, or when the pericardium
is damaged by cancer. Blunt or penetrating injury from
trauma to the chest or heart can also result in cardiac tam-
ponade when large amounts of blood fill the pericardium.
Tamponade can also occur during heart surgery.
When the heart is compressed by the surrounding
fluid, three conditions occur: a reduced amount of blood
is pumped to the body by the heart, the lower chambers
of the ventricles are filled with a less than normal amount
of blood, and higher than normal blood pressures occur
inside the heart, caused by the pressure of the fluid push-
ing in on the heart from the outside.
When tamponade occurs because of trauma, the
sound of the heart beats can become faint, and the blood
pressure in the arteries decreases, while the blood pres-
sure in the veins increases.
In cases of tamponade caused by more slowly devel-
oping diseases, shortness of breath, a feeling of tight-
ness in the chest, increased blood pressure in the large
veins in the neck (the jugular veins), weight gain, and
fluid retention by the body can occur.

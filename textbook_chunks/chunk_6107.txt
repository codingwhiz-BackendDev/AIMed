To determine the cause of a cough, a physician
should take an exact medical history and perform an
exam. Information regarding the duration of the cough,
what other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi-
ronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his or
her diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will also
help determine what type of infection, if any, may be
involved. The doctor may even observe the sputum
microscopically for the presence of bacteria and white
blood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presence
and extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo-
sis. If these actions are not enough to determine the cause
of the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be
ordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments to
inspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx.

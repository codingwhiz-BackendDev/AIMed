following:
• Inhaling a steaming mixture of lemon oil, thyme oil,
eucalyptus, and tea tree oil (Melaleuca spp.). (Aro-
matherapy)
• Gargling with a mixture of water, salt, and turmeric
powder or astringents such as alum, sumac, sage, and
bayberry to ease a sore throat. (Ayurvedic medicine)
• Taking coneflower (Echinacea spp.) or goldenseal
(Hydrastis canadensis). Other useful herbs to reduce
symptoms include yarrow (Achillea millefolium), eye-
bright (Euphrasia officinalis), garlic (Allium sativum),
and onions (Allium cepa). (Herbal)
• Microdoses of Viscue album, Natrum muriaticum, Alli-
um cepa, or Nux vomica. (Homeopathy)
• Taking yin chiao (sometimes transliterated as yinquiao)
tablets that contain honeysuckle and forsythia when
symptoms appear. Natural herb loquat syrup for cough
and sinus congestion and Chinese ephedra (ma-huang)
for runny nose. (Chinese traditional medicine)
• The use of zinc lozenges every two hours along with
high doses of vitamin C is suggested. Some practition-
ers also suggest eliminating dairy products for the dura-
tion of the cold. (Nutritional therapy).
The use of zinc lozenges may be moving toward
acceptance by practitioners of traditional medicine. In
1996 the Cleveland Clinic tested zinc gluconate lozenges
and found using zinc in the first 24 hours after cold
symptoms occurred shortened the duration of symptoms.

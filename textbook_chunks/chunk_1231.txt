than normal are significant for a patient’s overall diagno-

which are produced as a result of shock, typically are not
significant.
An ejection fraction, or a comparison of how much
blood is ejected from the heart’s left ventricle during its
contraction phase with a measurement of blood remain-
ing at the end of the left ventricle’s relaxation phase, is
also determined by performing a catheterization. The
cardiologist will look for a normal ejection fraction read-
ing of 60–70%.

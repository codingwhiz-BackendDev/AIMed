Patients are weighed immediately before and after
each hemodialysis treatment to assess their fluid reten-
tion. Blood pressure and temperature are taken and the
patient is assessed for physical changes since their last
dialysis run. Regular blood tests monitor chemical and
waste levels in the blood. Prior to treatment, patients are
typically administered a dose of heparin, an anticoagu-
lant that prevents blood clotting, to ensure the free flow
of blood through the dialyzer and an uninterrupted dialy-
sis run for the patient.

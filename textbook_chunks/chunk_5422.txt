A variety of herbal therapies can be useful in the
treatment of constipation. Several herbs, including
chamomile (Matricaria recutita), dandelion (Taraxacum
mongolicum), and burdock (Arctium lappa), act as bit-
ters, stimulating the movement of the digestive and
excretory systems. There are also “laxative” herbs that
assist with bowel movement. Two of these are senna
(Cassia senna) and buckthorn (Rhamnus purshiana).
These “laxative” herbs are stronger acting on elimination
than bitters and can sometimes cause cramping (mixing
them with a calming herb like fennel or caraway can help
reduce cramping). Both senna and buckthorn are power-
ful herbs that are best used with direction from an experi-
enced practitioner, since they can have adverse side
effects and the patient may become dependent on them.

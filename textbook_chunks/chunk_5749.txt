The cornea, the clear front part of the eye through
which light passes, is subject to many infections and to
injury from exposure and from foreign objects. Infection
and injury cause inflammation of the corneaâ€”a condi-
tion called keratitis. Tissue loss because of inflamma-
tion produces an ulcer. The ulcer can either be centrally
located, thus greatly affecting vision, or peripherally
located. There are about 30,000 cases of bacterial corneal
ulcers in the United States each year.

In some circumstances, a lumbar puncture to with-
draw a small amount of CSF for analysis may lead to
serious complications. Lumbar puncture should be per-
formed only with extreme caution, and only if the bene-
fits are thought to outweigh the risks, in certain condi-
tions. For example, in people who have blood clotting
(coagulation) or bleeding disorders, lumbar puncture
can cause bleeding that can compress the spinal cord. If
there is a large brain tumor or other mass, removal of
CSF can cause the brain to droop down within the skull
cavity (herniate), compressing the brain stem and other
vital structures, and leading to irreversible brain damage
or death. These problems are easily avoided by check-
ing blood coagulation through a blood test and by doing
a computed tomography scan (CT) or magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) scan before attempting the lum-
bar puncture. In addition, a lumbar puncture procedure
should never be performed at the site of a localized skin
infection on the lower back because the infection may
be introduced into the CSF and may spread to the brain
or spinal cord.

four to eight ounces of baking soda or one or two cups of
oatmeal to the bath is a good idea (oatmeal bath packets
are sold by pharmacies). Only mild soap should be used
in the bath. Patting, not rubbing, is recommended for dry-
ing the child off, to prevent irritating the blisters.
Calamine lotion (and some other kinds of lotions) also
help to reduce itchiness. Because scratching can cause
blisters to become infected and lead to scarring, the
child’s nails should be cut short. Of course, older children
need to be warned not to scratch. For babies, light mittens
or socks on the hands can help guard against scratching.
If mouth blisters make eating or drinking an
unpleasant experience, cold drinks and soft, bland foods
can ease the child’s discomfort. Painful genital blisters
can be treated with an anesthetic cream recommended by
a doctor or pharmacist. Antibiotics are often prescribed if
blisters become infected.
Fever and discomfort can be reduced by aceta-
minophen or another medication that does not contain
aspirin. Aspirin and any medications that contain
aspirin or other salicylates must not be used with chick-
enpox, for they appear to increase the chances of devel-
oping Reye’s syndrome. The best idea is to consult a doc-
tor or pharmacist if one is unsure about which medica-
tions are safe.
Immunocompromised chickenpox sufferers are
sometimes given an antiviral drug called acyclovir (Zovi-
rax). Studies have shown that Zovirax also lessens the
symptoms of otherwise healthy children and adults who
contract chickenpox, but the suggestion that it should be
used to treat the disease among the general population,
especially in children, is controversial.

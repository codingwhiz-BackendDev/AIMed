Pediatricians and family physicians suspect colic in
an infant who:
• has cried loudly for at least three hours a day at least
three times a week for three weeks or longer
• is not hungry but cries for several hours between din-
nertime and midnight
• demonstrates the clenched fists, rigidity, and other
physical traits associated with colic
The baby’s medical history and a parent’s descrip-
tion of eating, sleeping, and crying patterns are used to
confirm a diagnosis of colic. Physical examination and
laboratory tests are used to rule out infection, intestinal
blockage, and other conditions that can cause abdominal
pain and other colic-like symptoms.

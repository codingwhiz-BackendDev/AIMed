repeats present; the higher the number of repeats, the
greater the chance that the premutation will expand to a
full mutation in the next generation. All mothers of a child
with a full mutation are carriers of an FMR-1 gene expan-
sion. Ninety-nine percent of patients with fragile X syn-
drome have a CGG expansion, and less than one percent
have a point mutation or deletion on the FMR1 gene.
Individuals with fragile X syndrome appear normal
at birth but their development is delayed. Most boys with
fragile X syndrome have mental impairment. The severi-
ty of mental impairment ranges from learning disabilities
to severe mental retardation. Behavioral problems
include attention deficit and hyperactivity at a young age.
Some may show aggressive behavior in adulthood. Short
attention span, poor eye contact, delayed and disordered
speech and language, emotional instability, and unusual
hand mannerisms (hand flapping or hand biting) are also
seen frequently. Characteristic physical traits appear later
in childhood. These traits include a long and narrow face,
prominent jaw, large ears, and enlarged testes. In females
who carry a full mutation, the physical and behavioral
features and mental retardation tend to be less severe.
About 50% of females who have a full mutation are men-
tally retarded. Other behavioral characteristics include
whirling, spinning, and occasionally autism.
Children with fragile X syndrome often have fre-
quent ear and sinus infections. Nearsightedness and lazy
eye are also common. Many babies with fragile X syn-
drome may have trouble with sucking and some experi-
ence digestive disorders that cause frequent gagging and
vomiting. A small percentage of children with fragile X
syndrome may experience seizures. Children with fragile
X syndrome also tend to have loose joints which may
result in joint dislocations. Some children develop a cur-
vature in the spine, flat feet, and a heart condition known
as mitral valve prolapse.

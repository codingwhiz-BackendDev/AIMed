A candidate for chelation therapy should initially
have a thorough history and physical to define the type and
extent of clinical problems. Laboratory tests will be done
to determine whether there are any conditions present that
would prevent the use of chelation. Patients who have pre-
existing hypocalcemia, poor liver or kidney function, con-
gestive heart failure, hypoglycemia, tuberculosis, clot-
ting problems, or potentially allergic conditions are at
higher risk for complications from chelation therapy. A
Doppler ultrasound may be performed to determine the
adequacy of blood flow in different regions of the body.

Aorta—The main artery which carries blood from
the heart to the rest of the body The aorta is the
largest artery in the body.
Graft—To implant living tissue surgically. In coro-
nary artery bypass graft surgery, healthy veins or
arteries are grafted to coronary arteries.
Mammary artery—A chest wall artery that
descends from the aorta and is commonly used for
bypass grafts.
Saphenous vein—A long vein in the thigh or calf
commonly used for bypass grafts.
Ventricles—The left and right ventricles are the
large chambers of the heart. The ventricles propel
blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.
coronary artery bypass graft surgery is two to three per-
cent. Possible complications include graft closure and
development of blockages in other arteries, long-term
development of atherosclerotic disease of saphenous vein
grafts, abnormal heart rhythms, high or low blood pres-
sure, blood clots that can lead to a stroke or heart attack,
infections, and depression. There is a higher risk for com-
plications in patients who are heavy smokers, patients
who have serious lung, kidney, or metabolic problems, or
patients who have a reduced supply of blood to the brain.

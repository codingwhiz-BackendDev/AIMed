Eye cancer can occur in many parts of the eye
where a tumor can occur. Because of this there are sever-
al types of ocular cancer. Their occurrence varies in the
age of the affected individual. This article will focus on
retinoblastoma, the most common eye cancer in chil-
dren, and intraocular melanoma, the most common eye
cancer in adults.
Retinoblastoma can occur at any age but is most
often seen in children younger than five. About 200 chil-
dren a year are diagnosed with it in the United States.
Retinoblastoma starts with a small tumor in the retina,
the very back of the eye. In growing children, the retina
originates from cells called retinoblasts that grow and
divide very quickly. These cells eventually become the
mature cells of the retina when they stop growing. In the
case of retinoblastoma the retinoblasts donâ€™t stop grow-
ing and form a tumor that can continue to grow and cause
further complications if not treated quickly.

Symptoms begin after an incubation period of about a
day or so following ingestion of cysts. A brief period of flu-
like illness characterized by weakness and low-grade fever
is followed by watery diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, and
muscle aches. In some patients, symptoms may wax and
wane for weeks, and there are those in whom nausea and
burping may predominate. It is also believed that infection
can occur without any symptoms at all.
In patients with abnormal immunity (immunocom-
promised patients), such as those with AIDS and cancer,
prolonged diarrhea and severe weight loss often become
a major problem. The bile ducts are also susceptible to
infection in AIDS patients.

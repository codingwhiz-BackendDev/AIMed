Fecal incontinence arising from an underlying con-
dition such as diabetic neuropathy can sometimes be
helped by treating the underlying condition. When that
does not work, or no underlying condition can be discov-
ered, one approach is to have the patient use a supposito-
ry or enema to stimulate defecation at the same time
every day or every other day. The goal is to restore regu-
lar bowel habits and keep the bowels free of stools. Med-
ications such as loperamide (Imodium) and codeine
phosphate are often effective in halting incontinence, but
only in less severe cases involving liquid stools or
urgency. Dietary changes and exercises done at home to
strengthen the anal muscles may also help.
Good results have been reported for biofeedback
training, although the subject has not been properly
researched. In successful cases, patients regain complete
control over defecation, or at least improve their control,
by learning to contract the external part of the anal
sphincter whenever stools enter the rectum. All healthy

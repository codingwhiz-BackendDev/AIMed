Screening using the FOBT has been demonstrated to
reduce colorectal cancer. However, because only half of
colorectal cancers are FOBT-positive, FOBT must be
combined with regular screening endoscopy to increase
the detection of pre-malignant colorectal polyps and can-
cers. Since, through FOBT, cancer may be detected early,
the benefits of possible early detection must be consid-
ered along with the likelihood of complications and costs
for additional studies.

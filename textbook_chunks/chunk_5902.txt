time, but for one-third of patients the artery narrows
again within six months. The procedure can be repeated.
It is less invasive and less expensive than coronary artery
bypass surgery.
In coronary artery bypass surgery, a healthy artery or
vein from an arm, leg, or chest wall is used to build a
detour around the coronary artery blockage. The healthy
vessel then supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart.
Bypass surgery is major surgery. It is appropriate for
those patients with blockages in two or three major coro-
nary arteries, those with severely narrowed left main
coronary arteries, and those who have not responded to
other treatments. It is performed in a hospital under gen-
eral anesthesia. A heart-lung machine is used to support
the patient while the healthy vein or artery is attached
past the blockage to the coronary artery. About 70% of
patients who have bypass surgery experience full relief
from angina; about 20% experience partial relief. Only
about 3â€“4% of patients per year experience a return of
symptoms. Survival rates after bypass surgery decrease
over time. At five years after surgery, survival expectancy
is 90%; at 10 years about 80%, at 15 years about 55%,
and at 20 years about 40%.
Three semi-experimental surgical procedures for
unblocking coronary arteries are currently being studied.
Atherectomy is a procedure in which the cardiologist
shaves off and removes strips of plaque from the blocked
artery. In laser angioplasty, a catheter with a laser tip is
inserted into the affected artery to burn or break down the
plaque. A metal coil called a stent can be implanted per-
manently to keep a blocked artery open. Stenting is
becoming more common.

The most common cause of epiglottitis is infection
with the bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b.
Other types of bacteria are also occasionally responsi-
ble for this infection, including some types of Strepto-
coccus bacteria and the bacteria responsible for causing
diphtheria.
A patient with epiglottitis typically experiences a
sudden fever, and begins having severe throat and neck
pain. Because the swollen epiglottis interferes signifi-
cantly with air movement, every breath creates a loud,
harsh, high-pitched sound referred to as stridor. Because
the vocal cords are located in the larynx just below the
area of the epiglottis, the swollen epiglottis makes the
patientâ€™s voice sound muffled and strained. Swallowing
becomes difficult, and the patient may drool. The patient
often leans forward and juts out his or her jaw, while
struggling for breath.
Epiglottitis strikes suddenly and progresses quickly.
A child may begin complaining of a sore throat, and
within a few hours be suffering from extremely severe
airway obstruction.

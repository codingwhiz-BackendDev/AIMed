Eyeglasses and contact lenses are devices that cor-
rect refractive errors in vision. Eyeglass lenses are
mounted in frames worn on the face, sitting mostly on
the ears and nose, so that the lenses are positioned in
front of the eyes. Contact lenses appear to be worn in
direct contact with the cornea, but they actually float on a
layer of tears that separates them from the cornea.

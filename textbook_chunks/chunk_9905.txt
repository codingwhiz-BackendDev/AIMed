Special training is required for interpretation of the
electrocardiogram. To summarize the features used in inter-
pretations in the simplest manner, the P wave of the electro-
cardiogram is associated with the contraction of the atria.
The QRS series of waves, or QRS complex, is associated
with ventricular contraction, with the T wave coming after
the contraction. Finally, the P-Q or P-R interval gives a
value for the time taken for the electrical impulse to travel
from the atria to the ventricle (normally less than 0.2 sec).
The cause of dysrhythmia is ectopic beats. Ectopic
beats are premature heart beats that arise from a site
other than the sinus node—commonly from the atria,
atrioventricular node, or the ventricle. When these dys-
rhythmias are only occasional, they may produce no
symptoms, or a feeling of the heart turning over or “flip-
flopping” may be experienced. These occasional dys-
rhythmias are common in healthy people, but they also
can be an indication of heart disease.
The varied sources of dysrhythmias provide a wide
range of alterations in the form of the electrocardiogram.
Ectopic beats that start in the ventricle display an abnor-
mal QRS complex. This can indicate disease associated
with insufficient blood supply to the muscle (myocardial
ischemia). Multiple ectopic sites lead to rapid and unco-
ordinated contractions of the atria or ventricles. This con-
dition is known as fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, P
waves are absent, and the QRS complex appears at errat-
ic intervals, or “irregularly irregular.”
When the atrial impulse fails to reach the ventricle, a
condition known as heart block results. If this is partial,
the P-R interval (the time for the impulse to reach the ven-
tricle) is prolonged. If complete, the ventricles beat inde-
pendently of the atria at about 40 beats per minute, and
the QRS complex is mostly dissociated from the P wave.

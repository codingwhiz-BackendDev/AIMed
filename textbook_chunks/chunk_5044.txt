The goal of treatment for CAH is to return the
androgen levels to normal. This is usually accomplished
through drug therapy, although surgery is an alternative.
Lifelong treatment is required.
Drug therapy consists of a cortisol-like steroid med-
ication called a glucocorticoid. Oral hydrocortisone is
prescribed for children, and prednisone or dexametha-
sone is prescribed for older patients. For patients with
salt-wasting CAH, fludrocortisone, which acts like
aldosterone (the missing hormone), is also prescribed.
Infants and small children may also receive salt tablets,
while older patients are told to eat salty foods. Medical
therapy achieves hormonal balance most of the time, but
CAH patients can have periods of fluctuating hormonal
control that lead to increases in the dose of steroids pre-
scribed. Side effects of steroids include stunted growth.
Steroid therapy should not be suddenly stopped, since
adrenal insufficiency results.
Patients with CAH should see a pediatric endocrinol-
ogist frequently. The endocrinologist will assess height,

The nervous system consists of two major divisions:
the central nervous systems (CNS) which includes the
brain, the cranial nerves, and the spinal cord, and the
peripheral nervous system (PNS) which includes the
nerves that link the CNS with the sensory organs, mus-
cles, blood vessels, and glands of the body. These periph-
eral nerves are either motor, meaning that they are
involved in motor activity such as walking, or sensory,
meaning that they carry sensory information back to the
CNS. The PNS also works with the CNS to regulate
involuntary (autonomic) processes such as breathing,
heartbeat, blood pressure, etc.
There are two types of diffuse diabetic neuropathy
that affect different nervous system functions. Diffuse
peripheral neuropathy primarily affects the limbs, dam-
aging the nerves of the feet and hands. Autonomic neu-
ropathy is the other form of diffuse neuropathy and it
affects the heart and other internal organs.
Focal—or localized—diabetic neuropathy affects
specific nerves, most commonly in the torso, leg, or head.
Diabetic neuropathy can lead to muscular weakness,
loss of feeling or sensation, and loss of autonomic func-
tions such as digestion, erection, bladder control and
sweating among others.
The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely the
development of one or more forms of neuropathy.
Approximately 60–70% of patients with diabetes have
neuropathy, but only about 5% will experience painful
symptoms.

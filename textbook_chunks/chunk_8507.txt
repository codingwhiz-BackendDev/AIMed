Digitalis drugs may interact with a number of other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both
of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may
be greater. For example:
• Taking digitalis drugs with other heart medicines,
amphetamines, or diet pills could increase the risk of
heart rhythm problems.
• Calcium channel blockers, used to treat high blood
pressure, may cause higher than usual levels of digitalis
drugs in the body that could lead to symptoms of over-
dose as covered in the above section.
• Diuretics (water pills) or other medicines that lower the
amount of potassium in the body may increase the side
effects of digitalis drugs.
• Medicines that increase the amount of potassium in the
body may raise the risk of serious heart rhythm prob-
lems when taken with digitalis drugs.

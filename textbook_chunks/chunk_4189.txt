“toot.” It is most commonly inhaled or “snorted.” It may

Crack is a smokable form of cocaine that produces
an immediate and more intense high. It comes in off-
white chunks or chips called “rocks.” Little crumbs of
crack are sometimes called “kibbles & bits.”
In addition to their stand-alone use, both cocaine and
crack are often mixed with other substances. Cocaine
may be mixed with methcathinone (a more recent drug of
abuse, known as “cat,” that is similar to methampheta-
mine) to create a “wildcat.” A hollowed-out cigar filled
with a mixture of crack and marijuana is known as a
“woolah.” And either cocaine or crack used in conjunc-
tion with heroin is called a “speedball.” Cocaine used
together with alcohol represents the most common fatal
two-drug combination.

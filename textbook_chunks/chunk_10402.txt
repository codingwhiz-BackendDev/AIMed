Every person has four carotid arteries (the internal
and external carotids on each side of the neck) through
which blood from the heart moves into the brain. If one
of these arteries becomes blocked by fat and cholesterol,
the patient may have a range of symptoms, including:
• weakness in one arm, leg, half of the face, or one entire
side of the body
• numbness tingling
• paralysis of an arm, leg, or face
• slurred speech
• dizziness
• confusion, fainting, or coma
• stroke
Removing this fatty buildup, or bypassing a blocked
segment, may restore blood flow to the brain, eliminate
or decrease the symptoms, and lessen the risk of a stroke.

Some cases of congenital brain defects can be pre-
vented with good maternal nutrition, including folic
acid supplements. Folic acid is a vitamin that has been
shown to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects.

especially during the first trimester. Abstention from
drugs and alcohol during pregnancy may reduce risk.
Genetic counseling is advisable for parents who have
had one child with anencephaly, since the likelihood of
having another is increased.

Crohn’s disease is a life-long illness. The severity of
the disease can vary, and a patient can experience periods
of time when the disease is not active and he or she is
symptom-free. However, the complications and risks of
Crohn’s disease tend to increase over time. Well over
60% of all patients with Crohn’s disease will require
surgery, and about half of these patients will require
more than one operation over time. About 5–10% of all
Crohn’s patients will die of their disease, primarily due
to massive infection.

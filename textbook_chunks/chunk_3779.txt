A diet low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorous,
three substances that the kidneys regulate, is critical in
managing kidney disease. Other dietary restrictions, such
as a reduction in protein, may be prescribed depending
on the cause of kidney failure and the type of dialysis
treatment employed. Patients with chronic kidney failure
also need to limit their fluid intake.

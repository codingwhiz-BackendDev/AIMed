Coma, from the Greek word “koma,” meaning deep
sleep, is a state of extreme unresponsiveness, in which an
individual exhibits no voluntary movement or behavior.
Furthermore, in a deep coma, even painful stimuli
(actions which, when performed on a healthy individual,
result in reactions) are unable to affect any response, and
normal reflexes may be lost.

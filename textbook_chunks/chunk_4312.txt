During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision
behind the ear and opens the mastoid bone (the ridge on
the skull behind the ear) leading into the middle ear. The
surgeon then places the receiver-stimulator in the bone,
and gently threads the electrodes into the cochlea. This
operation takes between one and one-half to five hours.

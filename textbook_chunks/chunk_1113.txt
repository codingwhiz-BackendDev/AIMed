Carbon monoxide, sometimes called coal gas, has
been known as a toxic substance since the third century
B.C. It was used for executions and suicides in early Rome.
Today it is the leading cause of accidental poisoning in the
United States. According to the Journal of the American
Medical Association, 1,500 Americans die each year from
accidental exposure to CO, and another 2,300 from inten-
tional exposure (suicide). An additional 10,000 people
seek medical attention after exposure to CO and recover.
Anyone who is exposed to CO will become sick, and
the entire body is involved in CO poisoning. A develop-
ing fetus can also be poisoned if a pregnant woman
breathes CO gas. Infants, people with heart or lung dis-
ease, or those with anemia may be more seriously affect-
ed. People such as underground parking garage atten-
dants who are exposed to car exhausts in a confined area
are more likely to be poisoned by CO. Firemen also run a
higher risk of inhaling CO.

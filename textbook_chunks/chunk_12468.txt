Fasciotomy in the limbs is usually done by a surgeon
under general or regional anesthesia. An incision is made
in the skin, and a small area of fascia is removed where it
will best relieve pressure. Then the incision is closed.
Plantar fasciotomy is an endoscopic (performed with
the use of an endoscope) procedure. It is done by a foot
specialist in a doctorâ€™s office or outpatient surgical clinic
under local anesthesia and takes 20 minutes to one hour.
The doctor makes two small incisions on either side of
the heel. An endoscope is inserted in one to guide the
doctor in where to cut. A tiny knife is inserted in the
other. A portion of the fascia is cut from near the heel;
then the incisions are closed.

As a disorder, dizziness is classified into three cate-
goriesâ€”vertigo, syncope, and nonsyncope nonvertigo.
Each category has a characteristic set of symptoms, all
related to the sense of balance. In general, syncope is
defined by a brief loss of consciousness (fainting) or by
dimmed vision and feeling uncoordinated, confused, and
lightheaded. Many people experience a sensation like
syncope when they stand up too fast. Vertigo is the feeling
that either the individual or the surroundings are spinning.
This sensation is like being on a spinning amusement
park ride. Individuals with nonsyncope nonvertigo dizzi-
ness feel as though they cannot keep their balance. This
feeling may become worse with movement.

Cough suppressants act on the center in the brain
that controls the cough reflex. They are meant to be used
only to relieve dry, hacking coughs associated with colds
and flu. They should not be used to treat coughs that
bring up mucus or the chronic coughs associated with
smoking, asthma, emphysema or other lung problems.
Many cough medicines contain cough suppressants
along with other ingredients. Some combinations of
ingredients may cancel each other’s effects. One example
is the combination of cough suppressant with an expecto-
rant—a medicine that loosens and clears mucus from the
airways. The cough suppressant interferes with the ability
to cough up the mucus that the expectorant loosens.

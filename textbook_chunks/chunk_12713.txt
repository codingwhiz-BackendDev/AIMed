between Russia and Poland. When he was only a boy of
13, he traveled to Palestine on foot. The journey took a
year, and once there, young Feldenkrais worked as a
laborer and cartographer, also tutoring others in mathe-
matics. Moving to France in 1933, he graduated in
mechanical and electrical engineering from the Ecole
des Travaux Publiques de Paris.
Feldendrais became the first person to open a Judo
center in Paris after meeting with Jigaro Kano. He was
also one of the first Europeans to become a black belt in
Judo, in 1936.
Obtaining his Ph.D. at the Sorbonne, he went on to
assist Nobel Prize laureate, Frédéric Joliot-Curie at the
Curie Institute. During World War II in England, he
worked on the new sonar anti-submarine research.
Prompted by a recurring leg injury, he applied his
knowledge of the martial arts and his training as an
engineer to devise a method of re-integrating the body.
The concept was that more efficient movement would
allow for the treatment of pain or disability, and the bet-
ter-functioning of the body as a whole. Later on, he
would begin to teach what he had learned to others in
Tel Aviv.
In addition to many books about judo, including
Higher Judo, he wrote six books on his method.

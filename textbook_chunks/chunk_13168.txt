Fifth disease is usually suspected based on a
patient’s symptoms, including the typical appearance of
the bright red rash on the cheeks, patient history, age, and
the time of year. The physician will also exclude other
potential causes for the symptoms and rash, including
rubella, infectious mononucleosis, bacterial infections
like Lyme disease, allergic reactions, and lupus.
In addition, there is a blood test for fifth disease, but it
is generally used only for pregnant women and for people
who have weakened immune systems or who suffer from
blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia. The test
involves measuring for a particular antibody or protein that
the body produces in response to infection with the human
parvovirus B19. The test is 92–97% specific for this disease.
Because fifth disease can pose problems for an unborn
fetus exposed to the disease through the mother, testing
may also be conducted while a fetus is still in the uterus.
This test uses fluid collected from the sac around the fetus
(amniotic fluid) instead of blood to detect the viral DNA.

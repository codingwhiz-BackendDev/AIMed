Colds are diagnosed by observing a personâ€™s symp-
toms. There are no laboratory tests readily available to
detect the cold virus. However, a doctor may do a throat
culture or blood test to rule out a secondary infection.
Influenza is sometimes confused with a cold, but flu
causes much more severe symptoms and generally a
fever. Allergies to molds or pollens also can make the
nose run. Allergies are usually more persistent than the
common cold. An allergist can do tests to determine if
the cold-like symptoms are being caused by an allergic
reaction. Also, some people get a runny nose when they
go outside in winter and breathe cold air. This type of
runny nose is not a symptom of a cold.

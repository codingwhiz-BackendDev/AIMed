Cancer is not just one disease, but a large group of
almost one hundred diseases. Its two main characteristics
are uncontrolled growth of the cells in the human body
and the ability of these cells to migrate from the original
site and spread to distant sites. If the spread is not con-
trolled, cancer can result in death.

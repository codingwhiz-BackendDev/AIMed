Prognosis is the long-term outlook or survival after
therapy. Overall, about 50% of patients treated for colon
cancer survive the disease. As expected, the survival rates
are dependent upon the stage of the cancer at the time of
diagnosis, making early detection a very worthwhile
endeavor.
About 15% of patients present with stage I disease
and 85–90% survive. Stage II represents 20–30% of
cases and 65–75% survive. Thirt to forty percent com-
prise the stage III presentation of which 55% survive.
The remaining 20–25% present with stage IV disease
and are very rarely cured.

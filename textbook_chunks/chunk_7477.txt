Adults over the age of 60 who drink only when they
are thirsty probably get only about 90% of the fluid they
need. Developing a habit of drinking only in response to
the body’s thirst signals raises an older person’s risk of
becoming dehydrated. Seniors who have relocated to
areas where the weather is warmer or dryer than the cli-
mate they are accustomed to are even likelier to become
dehydrated unless they make it a practice to drink even
when they are not thirsty.

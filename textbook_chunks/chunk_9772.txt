Both forms of ehrlichiosis have similar symptoms,
and the illnesses can range from mild to severe and life-
threatening. Risk factors include old age and exposure to
ticks through work or recreation. Symptoms occur seven
to 21 days following a tick bite although patients may not
recall being bitten. Fever, tiredness, headache, muscle
aches, chills, loss of appetite, confusion, nausea, and
vomiting are common to both diseases. A rash may
occur.

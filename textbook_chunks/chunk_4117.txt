Christmas disease, or hemophilia B, is also heredi-
tary but less common than hemophilia A. The severity of
Christmas disease varies from mild to severe, although
mild cases are more common. The severity depends on
the degree of deficiency of the Factor IX (clotting factor).
Hemophilia B symptoms are similar to those of hemo-
philia A, including numerous, large, and deep bruises
and prolonged bleeding. The more dangerous symptoms
are those that represent possible internal bleeding, such
as swelling of joints, or bleeding into internal organs
upon trauma. Hemophilia most often occurs in families
with a known history of the disease, but occasionally,
new cases will occur in families with no apparent history.

azole (Septra, Bactrim), ampicillin (Amcill, Polycill) or
ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan, Cipro) are most frequently used.
Botulism is treated in a different way from other
bacterial food poisonings. Botulism antitoxin is given to
adults, but not infants, if it can be administered within 72
hours after symptoms are first observed. If given later, it
provides no benefit.
Both infants and adults require hospitalization, often
in the intensive care unit. If the ability to breathe is
impaired, patients are put on a mechanical ventilator to
assist their breathing and are fed intravenously until the
paralysis passes.

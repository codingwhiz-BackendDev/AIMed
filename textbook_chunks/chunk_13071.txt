Fibrocystic condition of the breast refers to technical
findings on diagnostic testing (signs); however, this dis-
cussion focuses on symptoms that may fall under the
general category of the fibrocystic condition. First, a
brief review of the structure and function of the breast
may be useful.
The breast is not supposed to be a soft, smooth organ.
It is actually a type of sweat gland. Milk, the breasts’ ver-
sion of sweat, is secreted when the breast receives appro-
priate hormonal and environmental stimulation.
The normal breast contains milk glands, with their
accompanying ducts, or pipelines, for transporting the
milk. These complex structures may not only alter in size,
but can increase or decrease in number as needed. Fibrous
connective tissue, fatty tissue, nerves, blood and lymph
vessels, and lymph nodes, with their different shapes and
textures, lie among the ever-changing milk glands. It is no
wonder that a woman’s breasts may not feel uniform in
texture and that the “lumpiness” may wax and wane.
The fibrocystic condition refers to the tenderness,
enlargement, and/or changing “lumpiness” that many
women encounter just before or during their menstrual
periods. At this time, female hormones are preparing the
breasts for pregnancy, by stimulating the milk-produc-
ing cells, and storing fluid. Each breast may contain as
much as three to six teaspoons of excess fluid. Swelling,
with increased sensitivity or pain, may result. If preg-
nancy does not occur, the body reabsorbs the fluid, and
the engorgement and discomfort are relieved.

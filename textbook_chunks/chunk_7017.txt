Most UTIs in adult males are complications of kid-
ney or prostate infections. They are usually associated
with a tumor or kidney stones that block the flow of
urine and are often persistent infections caused by drug-
resistant organisms. UTIs in men are most likely to be
caused by E. coli or another gram-negative bacterium. S.
saprophyticus, which is the second most common cause
of UTIs in women, rarely causes infections in men. Risk
factors for UTIs in men include:
• Lack of circumcision. The foreskin can harbor bacteria
that cause UTIs.
• Urinary catheterization. The longer the period of
catheterization, the higher the risk of UTIs.
The symptoms of cystitis and pyelonephritis in men
are the same as in women.

Cyclosporiasis refers to infection by the spore-form-
ing protozoan known as Cyclospora. Protozoa are a
group of parasites that infect the human intestine. Para-
sites are organisms that live in another body, called the
host, and get food and liquids from that host. This para-
site is a member of the group of protozoa known as coc-
cidia, to which Cryptosporidia also belongs. This group
of parasites infects the human intestine, and causes
chronic recurrent infections in those with altered immu-
nity or AIDS. Even in people with normal immune func-
tion, Cyclopsora can cause prolonged bouts of diarrhea
and other gastrointestinal symptoms.

Although epididymitis can be caused by the same
organisms that cause some sexually transmitted dis-
eases (STDs) or occur after prostate surgery, the condi-
tion is generally due to pus-generating bacteria associat-
ed with infections in other parts of the body.
Epididymitis can also be caused by injury or infec-
tion of the scrotum or by irritation from urine that has
accumulated in the vas deferens (the duct through which
sperm travels after leaving the epididymis).
Epididymitis is characterized by sudden redness and
swelling of the scrotum. The affected testicle is hard and
sore, and the other testicle may feel tender. The patient
has chills and fever and usually has acute urethritis
(inflammation of the urethra).
Enlarged lymph nodes in the groin cause scrotal pain
that intensifies throughout the day and may become so
severe that walking normally becomes impossible.

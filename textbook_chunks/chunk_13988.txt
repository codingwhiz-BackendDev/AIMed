Like frostbite, frostnip is associated with ice crystal
formation in the tissues, but no tissue destruction occurs and
the crystals dissolve as soon as the skin is warmed. Frostnip
affects areas such as the earlobes, cheeks, nose, fingers, and
toes. The skin turns pale and one experiences numbness or
tingling in the affected part until warming begins.

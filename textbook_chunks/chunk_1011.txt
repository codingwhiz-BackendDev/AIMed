Anything that weakens the body’s natural barrier
against colonizing organisms—including stomach
surgery, burns, nasogastric tubes, and catheters—can
predispose a person for deep organ candidiasis. Rising
numbers of AIDS patients, organ transplant recipients,
and other individuals whose immune systems are com-
promised help account for the dramatic increase in deep
organ candidiasis in recent years. Patients with granulo-
cytopenia (deficiency of white blood cells) are particular-
ly at risk for deep organ candidiasis.

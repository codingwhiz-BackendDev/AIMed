Treatment is determined by the underlying cause. If
an individual has a cold or influenza, a few days of bed
rest is usually adequate to resolve dizziness. Other caus-
es of dizziness, such as mild vestibular system damage,
may resolve without medical treatment.
If dizziness continues, drug therapy may prove
helpful. Because circulatory problems often cause dizzi-
ness, medication may be prescribed to control blood
pressure or to treat arteriosclerosis. Sedatives may be
useful to relieve the tension that can trigger or aggravate
dizziness. Low blood sugar associated with diabetes
sometimes causes dizziness and is treated by controlling
blood sugar levels. An individual may be asked to avoid
caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and any substances that
cause allergic reactions. A low-salt diet may also help
some people.
When other measures have failed, surgery may be
suggested to relieve pressure on the inner ear. If the
dizziness is not treatable by drugs, surgery, or other
means, physical therapy may be used and the patient may
be taught coping mechanisms for the problem.

Using a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air
taken into and exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will deter-
mine two important values: (1) vital capacity (VC), the largest
amount of air expelled after the deepest inhalation, and (2)
forced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum amount of
air expired in one second. The pulmonary function test can
be performed in the doctorâ€™s office, but is expensive.

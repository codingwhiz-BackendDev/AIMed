Hemodialysis is the most frequently prescribed type
of dialysis treatment in the United States. The treatment
involves circulating the patient’s blood outside of the
body through an extracorporeal circuit (ECC), or dialysis
circuit. Two needles are inserted into the patient’s vein,
or access site, and are attached to the ECC, which con-
sists of plastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer
(artificial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors
and maintains blood flow and administers dialysate.
Dialysate is a chemical bath that is used to draw waste
products out of the blood.
Since the 1980s, the majority of hemodialysis treat-
ments in the United States have been performed with
hollow fiber dialyzers. A hollow fiber dialyzer is com-
posed of thousands of tube-like hollow fiber strands
encased in a clear plastic cylinder several inches in diam-
eter. There are two compartments within the dialyzer (the
blood compartment and the dialysate compartment). The
membrane that separates these two compartments is
semipermeable. This means that it allows the passage of
certain sized molecules across it, but prevents the pas-

Herbal remedies that act as circulatory stimulants
can offset the symptoms of fatigue in some individuals.
An herbalist may recommend an infusion of ginger (Zin-
giber officinale) root or treatment with cayenne (Cap-
sicum annuum), balmony (Chelone glabra), damiana
(Turnera diffusa), ginseng (Panax ginseng), or rosemary
(Rosmarinus officinalis) to treat ongoing fatigue.
An infusion is prepared by mixing the herb with
boiling water, steeping it for several minutes, and then
removing the herb from the infusion before drinking. A
strainer, tea ball, or infuser can be used to immerse loose
herb in the boiling water before steeping and separating
it. A second method of infusion is to mix the loose herbal
preparation with cold water first, bringing the mixture to
a boil in a pan or teapot, and then separating the tea from
the infusion with a strainer before drinking.
Caffeine-containing central nervous system stimu-
lants such as tea (Camellia senensis) and cola (Cola niti-
da) can provide temporary, short-term relief of fatigue
symptoms. However, long-term use of caffeine can cause
restlessness, irritability, and other unwanted side effects,
and in some cases may actually work to increase fatigue
after the stimulating effects of the caffeine wear off. To
avoid these problems, caffeine intake should be limited
to 300 mg or less a day (the equivalent of 4-8 cups of
brewed, hot tea).

Congestive cardiomyopathy may be caused by a
number of conditions. Cardiomyopathy with a known
cause is called secondary cardiomyopathy. When no
cause can be identified, it is called primary cardiomyopa-
thy or idiopathic cardiomyopathy. About 80% of all cases
of cardiomyopathy do not have a known cause. Many
heart specialists think that many cases of idiopathic con-
gestive cardiomyopathy may be caused by a viral infec-
tion. Because cardiomyopathy may occur many years
after a viral infection and viruses sometimes go undetect-
ed in laboratory tests, it is difficult to know if a virus is the
cause. Some people have a weak heart from advanced
coronary artery disease that causes heart muscle dam-
age. This is sometimes called ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Conditions that can cause congestive cardiomyopa-
thy are:
• Coronary artery disease
• Infections

There should be some brief EMG activity during
needle insertion. This activity may be increased in dis-
eases of the nerve and decreased in long-standing muscle
disorders where muscle tissue is replaced by fibrous tis-
sue or fat. Muscle tissue normally shows no EMG activi-
ty when at rest or when moved passively by the examin-
er. When the patient actively contracts the muscle, spikes
(motor unit action potentials) should appear on the
recording screen, reflecting the electrical activity within.
As the muscle is contracted more forcefully, more groups
of muscle fibers are recruited or activated, causing more
EMG activity.

for uncomplicated diverticulitis usually
requires hospitalization. “Resting the bowel” is a main-
stay of treatment, and involves keeping the patient from
eating or sometimes even drinking anything by mouth.
Therefore, the patient will need to receive fluids through
a needle in the vein (intravenous or IV fluids). Antibi-
otics will also be administered through the IV. Some
physicians will agree to try treatment at home for very
mildly ill patients. These patients will be put on a liquid
diet and receive oral antibiotics.

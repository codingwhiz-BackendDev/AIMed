One important aspect of diagnosing food poisoning
is for doctors to determine if a number of people have
eaten the same food and show the same symptoms of ill-
ness. When this happens, food poisoning is strongly sus-
pected. The diagnosis is confirmed when the suspected
bacteria is found in a stool culture or a fecal smear from
the person. Other laboratory tests are used to isolate bac-
teria from a sample of the contaminated food. Botulism
is usually diagnosed from its distinctive neurological
symptoms, since rapid treatment is essential. Many cases
of food poisoning go undiagnosed, since a definite diag-
nosis is not necessary to effectively treat the symptoms.
Because it takes time for symptoms to develop, it is not
necessarily the most recent food one has eaten that is the
cause of the symptoms.

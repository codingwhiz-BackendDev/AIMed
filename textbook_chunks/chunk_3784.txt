Early diagnosis and treatment of kidney failure is criti-
cal to improving length and quality of life in chronic kidney
failure patients. Patient outcome varies by the cause of
chronic kidney failure and the method chosen to treat it.
Overall, patients with chronic kidney disease leading to
ESRD have a shortened lifespan. According to the United
States Renal Data System (USRDS), the lifespan of an
ESRD patient is 18–47% of the lifespan of the age-sex-race
matched general population. ESRD patients on dialysis
have a lifespan that is 16–37% of the general population.
The demand for kidneys to transplant continues to
exceed supply. In 1996, over 34,000 Americans were on
the UNOS waiting list for a kidney transplant, but only
11,330 living donor and cadaver transplants were actual-
ly performed. Cadaver kidney transplants have a 50%
chance of functioning nine years, and living donor kid-
neys that have two matching antigen pairs have a 50%
chance of functioning for 24 years. However, some trans-
plant grafts have functioned for over 30 years.

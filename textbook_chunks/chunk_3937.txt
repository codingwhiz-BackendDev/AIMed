Cirrhosis-related liver damage cannot be reversed,
but further damage can be prevented by patients who:
• eat properly
• get enough rest
• do not consume alcohol
• remain free of infection
If the underlying cause of cirrhosis cannot be cor-
rected or removed, scarring will continue. The liver will
fail, and the patient will probably die within five years.
Patients who stop drinking after being diagnosed with
cirrhosis can increase their likelihood of living more than
a few years from 40% to 60–70%.

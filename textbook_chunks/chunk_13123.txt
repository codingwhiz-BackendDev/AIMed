The exact cause of fibromyalgia is not known.
Sometimes it occurs in several members of a family,
suggesting that it may be an inherited disorder. People
with fibromyalgia are most likely to complain of three
primary symptoms: muscle and joint pain, stiffness, and
fatigue.
Pain is the major symptom with aches, tenderness,
and stiffness of multiple muscles, joints, and soft tissues.
The pain also tends to move from one part of the body to
another. It is most common in the neck, shoulders, chest,
arms, legs, hips, and back. Although the pain is present
most of the time and may last for years, the severity of
the pain is changeable and dependent on individual
patient perception.

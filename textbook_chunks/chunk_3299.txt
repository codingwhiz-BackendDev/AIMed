Cholera is spread by eating food or drinking water
that has been contaminated with cholera bacteria. Conta-
mination usually occurs when human feces from a per-
son who has the disease seeps into a community water
supply. Fruits and vegetables can also be contaminated in
areas where crops are fertilized with human feces.
Cholera bacteria also live in warm, brackish water and
can infect persons who eat raw or undercooked seafood
obtained from such waters. Cholera is rarely transmitted
directly from one person to another.
Cholera often occurs in outbreaks or epidemics. The
World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that during
any cholera epidemic, approximately 0.2â€“1% of the local
population will contract the disease. Anyone can get
cholera, but infants, children, and the elderly are more
likely to die from the disease because they become dehy-
drated faster than adults. There is no particular season in
which cholera is more likely to occur.
Because of an extensive system of sewage and water
treatment in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan,
and Australia, cholera is generally not a concern for visi-
tors and residents of these countries. People visiting or
living in other parts of the world, particularly on the Indi-
an subcontinent and in parts of Africa and South Ameri-
ca, should be aware of the potential for contracting
cholera and practice prevention. Fortunately, the disease
is both preventable and treatable.

An ophthalmologist uses ultrasonic imaging to help
diagnose the underlying cause(s) of a patient’s symp-
toms, to assess the general condition of an injured eye,
and to measure the eye prior to corrective surgery. Situa-
tions that may call for ultrasonic imaging include:
• Excessive tearing or visible infection. These external
symptoms could indicate a serious underlying problem
such as a tumor, an internal infection, the presence of a
deeply lodged irritant (foreign body), or the effects of a
previously unrecognized injury. When presented with
general symptoms, ultrasound can speed diagnosis if a
serious condition is suspected.
• Impaired vision. Fuzzy vision, poor night vision,
restricted (tunnel) vision, blind spots, extreme light
sensitivity, and even blindness can all stem from inner
eye conditions ranging from glaucoma and cataracts,
to retinitis, detached retina, tumors, or impaired blood
circulation. Again, high resolution ultrasound can
quickly identify causes and pinpoint their location. A
special type of ultrasound, known as Doppler, can even
perceive and measure circulation in the tiny blood ves-
sels of the eye.
• Eye trauma. The eye can be damaged by a direct impact
or a puncture wound, as a result of a general head trau-
ma, or by intense light exposure. Even when the cause
of injury is obvious, ultrasound can reveal the exact
type, extent, and location of damage, from deforma-
tions and ruptures to internal bleeding, and help to
guide emergency care efforts.
• Lens replacement surgery. Exact measurement of the
eye’s optical dimensions with ultrasound greatly
improves the visual outcome for cataract patients
receiving permanent synthetic lenses; and for severely
myopic patients receiving implanted corrective lenses.
Ophthalmic ultrasound imaging is also used routine-
ly to guide the precise placement of instruments during
surgery, and can be used directly for the treatment of
glaucoma and tumors of the eye.

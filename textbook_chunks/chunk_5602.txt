The most common reason for cooling a body is
fever or hyperthermia (extremely high fever). The body
can sustain temperatures up to 104째F (40째C) with rela-
tive safety; however, when temperatures rise above
104째F (40째C), damage to the brain, muscles, blood, and
kidneys is increasingly likely. Cooling treatments are
also applied immediately following sprains, bruises,
burns, eye injuries, and muscle spasms to help alleviate
the resulting swelling, pain, and discoloration of the skin.

The brain coordinates information from the eyes, the
inner ear, and the body’s senses to maintain balance. If
any of these information sources is disrupted, the brain
may not be able to compensate. For example, people
sometimes experience motion sickness because the
information from their body tells the brain that they are
sitting still, but information from the eyes indicates that
they are moving. The messages don’t correspond and
dizziness results.
Vision and the body’s senses are the most important
systems for maintaining balance, but problems in the
inner ear are the most frequent cause of dizziness. The
inner ear, also called the vestibular system, contains fluid
that helps fine tune the information the brain receives
from the eyes and the body. When fluid volume or pres-
sure in one inner ear changes, information about balance
is altered. The discrepancy gives conflicting messages to
the brain about balance and induces dizziness.
Certain medical conditions can cause dizziness,
because they affect the systems that maintain balance.
For example, the inner ear is very sensitive to changes in
blood flow. Because medical conditions such as high
blood pressure or low blood sugar can affect blood flow,
these conditions are frequently accompanied by dizzi-
ness. Circulation disorders are the most common causes
of dizziness. Other causes are head injury, ear infection,
allergies, and nervous system disorders.
Dizziness often disappears without treatment or with
treatment of the underlying problem, but it can be long
term or chronic. According to the National Institutes of
Health, 42% of Americans will seek medical help for
dizziness at some point in their lives. The costs may
exceed a billion dollars and account for five million doc-
tor visits annually. Episodes of dizziness increase with
age. Among people aged 75 or older, dizziness is the
most frequent reason for seeing a doctor.

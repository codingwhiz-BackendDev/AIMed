Echocardiography is used to diagnose certain cardio-
vascular diseases. In fact, it is one of the most widely used
diagnostic tests for heart disease. It can provide a wealth
of helpful information, including the size and shape of the
heart, its pumping strength, and the location and extent of
any damage to its tissues. It is especially useful for assess-
ing diseases of the heart valves. It not only allows doctors
to evaluate the heart valves, but it can detect abnormalities
in the pattern of blood flow, such as the backward flow of
blood through partly closed heart valves, known as regur-
gitation. By assessing the motion of the heart wall,
echocardiography can help detect the presence and assess
the severity of coronary artery disease, as well as help
determine whether any chest pain is related to heart dis-
ease. Echocardiography can also help detect hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, in which the walls of the heart thicken
in an attempt to compensate for heart muscle weakness.
The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it is
noninvasive (doesnâ€™t involve breaking the skin or entering
body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.

There are many possible causes of FUO; generally
though, a diagnosis can be found. About 10% of patients
will wind up without a definite cause, and about the same
percentage have “factitious fevers” (either self induced
or no fever at all).
Some general symptoms tend to occur along with
fever; these are called constitutional symptoms and con-
sist of myalgias (muscle aches), chills, and headache.

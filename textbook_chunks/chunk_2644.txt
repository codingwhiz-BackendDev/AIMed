Oral chemotherapy is given by mouth in the form a
pill, capsule, or liquid. This is the easiest method and can
usually be done at home.
Intravenous (IV) chemotherapy is injected into a
vein. A small needle is inserted into a vein on the hand or
lower arm. The needle is usually attached to a small tube
called a catheter, which delivers the drug to the needle
from an IV bag or bottle.
Intramuscular (IM) chemotherapy is injected into a
muscle. Chemotherapy given by intramuscular injection
is absorbed into the blood more slowly than IV
chemotherapy. Because of this, the effects of IM
chemotherapy may last longer than chemotherapy given
intravenously. Chemotherapy may also be injected sub-
cutaneously (SQ or SC), which means under the skin.
Injection of chemotherapy directly into the cancer is
called intralesional (IL) injection.
Chemotherapy may also be given by a catheter or
port permanently inserted into a central vein or body cav-
ity. A port is a small reservoir or container that is placed
in a vein or under the skin in the area where the drug will
be given. These methods eliminate the need for repeated
injections and may allow patients to spend less time in
the hospital while receiving chemotherapy. A common
location for a permanent catheter is the external jugular
vein in the neck. Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is
administered into the abdominal cavity through a
catheter or port. Chemotherapy given by catheter or port
into the spinal fluid is called intrathecal (IT) administra-
tion. Catheters and ports may also be placed in the chest
cavity, bladder, or pelvis, depending on the location of
the cancer to be treated.
Topical chemotherapy is given as a cream or oint-
ment applied directly to the cancer. This method is more
common in treatment of certain types of skin cancer.

Circumcision should not be performed on infants
with certain deformities of the penis that may require a
portion of the foreskin for repair. The most common con-
dition for surgery using the foreskin is hypospadias, a
congenital deformity of the penis where the urinary tract
opening is not at the tip of the glans. Also, infants with a
large hydrocoele or hernia may suffer important compli-
cations through circumcision. Premature infants and
infants with serious infections are also poor candidates to
be circumcised, as are infants with hemophilia, other
bleeding disorders, or whose mothers had taken anticoag-
ulant drugs. In older boys or men, circumcision is a minor
procedure. Therefore, it can be performed in virtually
anyone without a serious illness or unusual deformity.

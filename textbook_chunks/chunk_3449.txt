There are four different classes of cholesterol lower-
ing drugs:
Bile acid sequesterants are drugs that act by binding
with the bile produced by the liver. Bile helps the diges-
tion and absorption of fats in the intestine. By blocking
the digestion of fats, bile acid sequesterants prevent the
formation of cholesterol. Drugs in this class include:
cholestyramine (Questran); colestipol (Colestid); and
colesevalam (Welchol).
HMG-CoA inhibitors, often called “statins,” are
drugs that block an enzyme called “3-hydroxy-3-methyl-
glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.” This blocks one of the
steps in converting fat to cholesterol. These are the most
effective cholesterol lowering agents available. Drugs in
this group include: atorvastatin (Lipitor); cerivastatin
(Baycol); fluvastatin (Lescol); lovastatin (Mevacor);
pravastatin (Pravachol); and simvastatin (Zocor).
Fibric acid derivatives include clofibrate (Atromid-
S); gemfibrozil (Lopid); and fenofibrate (Tricor).
Although these drugs are less effective than the statins at
lowering total cholesterol, they may be able to lower the
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while raising
the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Their
exact mechanism of action is believed to be associated
with inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity.
Niacin, vitamin B-3, is also effective in lowering
cholesterol levels. Although the normal vitamin dose of
niacin is only 20 mg, the dose required to reduce choles-
terol levels is at least 500 mg each day. The mechanism
of action of niacin in cholesterol reduction is associated
with the inhibition of VLDL secretion in the blood-
stream.

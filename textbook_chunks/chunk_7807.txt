Psychotherapy explores an individual’s life to bring
to light possible contributing causes of the present
depression. During treatment, the therapist helps the
patient to become self-aware of his or her thinking pat-
terns and how they came to be. There are several differ-
ent subtypes of psychotherapy, but all have the common
goal of helping the patient develop healthy problem solv-
ing and coping skills.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy assumes that the
patient’s faulty thinking is causing the current depression
and focuses on changing the depressed patient’s thought
patterns and perceptions. The therapist helps the patient
identify negative or distorted thought patterns and the
emotions and behavior that accompany them, and then
retrains the depressed individual to recognize the think-
ing and react differently to it.

of scombroid occur quickly after eating
the fish, as soon as 10 minutes. Since histamine is
released by certain cells in the body during an allergic
reaction, scombroid can be confused with a fish allergy.
Scombroid causes flushing of the face, sweating, a burn-
ing feeling in the mouth or throat, vomiting, diarrhea,
and headaches. A rash that looks like a sunburn may
occur, and a small number of patients have hives. Some
patients have a metallic or peppery taste in their mouths.
In more severe cases, rapid pulse, blurred vision, and dif-
ficulty breathing can occur. Symptoms usually last about
four hours.

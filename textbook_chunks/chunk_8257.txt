Because there is a great deal of blood exposure
involved in dialysis treatment, a slight risk of contracting
hepatitis B and hepatitis C exists. The hepatitis B vacci-
nation is recommended for most hemodialysis patients.
As of 1997, there has only been one documented case of
HIV being transmitted in a United States dialysis unit to
a staff member, and no documented cases of HIV ever
being transmitted between dialysis patients in the United
States. The strict standards of infection control practiced
in modern hemodialysis units makes the chance of con-
tracting one of these diseases very small.

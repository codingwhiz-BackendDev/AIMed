Although severe endometriosis should not be self-
treated, many women find they can help their condition
through alternative therapies. Taking vitamin B complex
combined with vitamins C, E, and the minerals calcium,
magnesium, and selenium can help the depression and
lack of energy that may accompany endometriosis. B vit-
amins also counteract the side effects of hormonal drugs.
Other women have found relief when they turned to a
macrobiotic diet. Less extreme diets that cut out sugar,
salt, and processed foods are sometimes helpful as well.
Mind-body therapies such as relaxation and visualization
help women cope with pain. Other avenues to combat
pain include acupuncture and biofeedback techniques.
Still other women report positive results after being treat-
ed by chiropractors or homeopathic doctors.

Physical, intellectual, emotional, and social matura-
tion are all important markers of a child’s overall health
and well-being. When evaluating children, pediatricians
and child-care specialists assess related skill sets, such as
a child’s acquisition and use of language, fine and gross
motor skills, cognitive growth, and socialization, and
achievement of certain milestones in these areas. A
developmental milestone is a task or skill set that a child
is expected to reach at a certain age or stage of life. For
example, by age one, most children have achieved the
physical milestone of walking with the assistance of an
adult. Developmental disorders may be identified and/or
diagnosed by physicians, teachers, child psychologists,
therapists, counselors, and other professionals who inter-
act with children on a regular basis.
It is important to remember that all children are
unique, and develop at different paces within this broad
framework. Reaching a milestone early or late does not
necessarily indicate a developmental problem. However,
if a child is consistently lagging on achieving milestones,
or has a significant deficit in one developmental area, he
or she may be experiencing developmental delays.
Pediatricians and other medical professionals typi-
cally diagnose physical illness and disease in children. In
cases of illness and injury, children will undergo a thor-
ough physical examination and patient history. Diag-
nostic tests may be performed as appropriate. In cases of
mental or emotional disorders, a psychologist or other
mental healthcare professional will meet with the patient
to conduct an interview and take a detailed social and
medical history. Interviews with a parent or guardian
may also be part of the diagnostic process. The physician
may also administer one or more psychological tests
(also called clinical inventories, scales, or assessments).

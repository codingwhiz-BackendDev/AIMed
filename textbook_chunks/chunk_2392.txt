• Acute phase lasts about two months, with non-specific
symptoms of low grade fever, headache, fatigue, and
enlarged liver or spleen.
• Indeterminate phase lasts 10–20 years, during which
time no symptoms occur, but the parasites are repro-
ducing in various organs.
• Chronic phase is the stage when symptoms related to
damage of major organs (heart, esophagus, colon) begin.
In the chronic phase, irregularities of heart rhythm,
heart failure, and blood clots cause weakness, fainting,
and even sudden death.

Chagas’ disease
Esophageal symptoms are related to difficulty with
swallowing and chest pain. Because the esophagus does
not empty properly, food regurgitates into the lungs caus-
ing cough, bronchitis, and repeated bouts of pneumo-
nia. Inability to eat, weight loss, and malnutrition
become a significant factor in affecting survival.
Involvement of the large intestine (colon) causes
constipation, distention, and abdominal pain.

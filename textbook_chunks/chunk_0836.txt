Radiation kills tumor cells. Radiation is used alone
in cases where a tumor is unsuitable for surgery. More
often, it is used in conjunction with surgery and
chemotherapy. Radiation can be either external or inter-
nal. In the external form, the radiation is aimed at the
tumor from outside the body. In internal radiation (also
known as brachytherapy), a radioactive substance in the
form of pellets or liquid is placed at the cancerous site
by means of a pill, injection or insertion in a sealed con-
tainer.

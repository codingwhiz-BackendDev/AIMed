Low levels of EPO are found in anemic patients with
inadequate or absent production of erythropoietin.
Severe kidney disease may decrease production of EPO,
and congenital absence of EPO can occur.
Elevated levels of EPO can be found in some ane-
mias when the body tries to overcompensate for reduced
blood volume. Elevated levels are also seen in poly-
cythemia, and erythropoietin-secreting tumors.

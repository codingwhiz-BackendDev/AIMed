Theoretically, cognitive-behavioral therapy can be
employed in any situation in which there is a pattern of
unwanted behavior accompanied by distress and impair-
ment. It is a recommended treatment option for a number
of mental disorders, including affective (mood) disor-
ders, personality disorders, social phobia, obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, substance
abuse, anxiety or panic disorder, agoraphobia, post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is also fre-
quently used as a tool to deal with chronic pain for
patients with illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis,
back problems, and cancer. Patients with sleep disor-
ders may also find cognitive-behavioral therapy a useful
treatment for insomnia.

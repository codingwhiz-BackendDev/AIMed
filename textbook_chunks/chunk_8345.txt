To most individuals, diarrhea means an increased
frequency or decreased consistency of bowel move-
ments; however, the medical definition is more exact
than this. In many developed countries, the average num-
ber of bowel movements is three per day. However,
researchers have found that diarrhea best correlates with
an increase in stool weight; stool weights above 10 oz
(300 g) per day generally indicates diarrhea. This is
mainly due to excess water, which normally makes up
60â€“85% of fecal matter. In this way, true diarrhea is dis-
tinguished from diseases that cause only an increase in
the number of bowel movements (hyperdefecation), or
incontinence (involuntary loss of bowel contents).
Diarrhea is also classified by physicians into acute,
which lasts one to two weeks, and chronic, which contin-
ues for longer than 23 weeks. Viral and bacterial infec-
tions are the most common causes of acute diarrhea.

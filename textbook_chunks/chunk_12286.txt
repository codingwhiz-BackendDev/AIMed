Osteoarthritis—A disease characterized by dam-
age to the cartilage in the joints. The joints
become inflamed, deformed, and enlarged, and
movement becomes painful.
Stokes-Adams syndrome—Recurrent episodes of
temporary loss of consciousness (fainting) caused
by an insufficient flow of blood from the heart to
the brain. This syndrome is caused by a very rapid
or a very slow heartbeat.
Transient ischemic attack (TIA)—A brief interrup-
tion of the blood supply to part of the brain that
causes a temporary impairment of vision, speech,
or movement. Usually, the episode lasts for just a
few moments, but it may be a warning sign for a
full-scale stroke.
Vagus nerve—A cranial nerve, that is, a nerve con-
nected to the brain. The vagus nerve has branches
to most of the major organs in the body, including
the larynx, throat, windpipe, lungs, heart, and
most of the digestive system.
A person who has fainted should lie flat for 10–15
minutes after regaining consciousness to give the system
a chance to regain its balance. Standing up too soon may
bring on another fainting spell.

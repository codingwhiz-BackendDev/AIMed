During the initial medical examination, an individ-
ual with dizziness should provide a detailed description
of the type of dizziness experienced, when it occurs, and
how often each episode lasts. A diary of symptoms may
help track this information. Report any symptoms that
accompany the dizziness, such as a ringing in the ear or
nausea, any recent injury or infection, and any medica-
tion taken.
Blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and body temper-
ature are checked, and the ear, nose, and throat are scruti-
nized. The sense of balance is assessed by moving the
individualâ€™s head to various positions or by tilt-table test-
ing. In tilt-table testing, the person lies on a table that can
be shifted into different positions and reports any dizzi-
ness that occurs.
Further tests may be indicated by the initial exami-
nation. Hearing tests help assess ear damage. x rays,
computed tomography scan (CT scan), and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) can pinpoint evidence of
nerve damage, tumor, or other structural problems. If a
vestibular disorder is suspected, a technique called
electronystagmography (ENG) may be used. ENG mea-
sures the electrical impulses generated by eye move-
ments. Blood tests can determine diabetes, high choles-
terol, and other diseases. In some cases, a heart evalua-
tion may be useful. Despite thorough testing, an underly-
ing cause cannot always be determined.

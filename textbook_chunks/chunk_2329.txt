Practicing safe sexual behavior, such as monogamy,
is one way of lowering the prevalence of cervicitis. In
addition, women who began sexual activity at a later age
have been shown to have a lower incidence of cervicitis.
Another recommendation is to use a latex condom con-
sistently during intercourse. If the cervicitis is caused by
any sexually transmitted disease, the patient is advised to
notify all sexual partners.

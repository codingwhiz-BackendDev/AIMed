The treatment of severe mental illness, such as
schizophrenia, using electroconvulsive therapy was
introduced in 1938 by two Italian doctors named Cerletti
and Bini. In those days many doctors believed that con-
vulsions were incompatible with schizophrenia since,
according to their obervations, this disease rarely
occurred in individuals suffering from epilepsy. They
concluded, therefore, that if convulsions could be artifi-
cally produced in patients with schizophrenia, the illness
could be cured. Some doctors were already using a vari-
ety of chemicals to produce seizures, but many of their
patients died or suffered severe injuries because the
strength of the convulsions could not be well controlled.
Electroconvulsive therapy is among the most contro-
versial of all procedures used to treat mental illness.
When it was first introduced, many people were fright-
ened simply because it was called “shock treatment.”
Many assumed the procedure would be painful, others
thought it was a form of electrocution, and still others
believed it would cause brain damage. Unfortunately,
unfavorable publicity in newspapers, magazines, and
movies added to these fears.
Indeed, in those early years, patients and families
were rarely educated by doctors and nurses regarding this
or other forms of psychiatric treatment. In addition, no
anesthesia or muscle relaxants were used. As a result,
patients had violent seizures, and even though they did
not remember them, the procedure itself was frightening.
The way these treatments are given today is very dif-
ferent from the procedures used in the past. Currently,
ECT is offered on both an inpatient and outpatient basis.
Hospitals have specially equipped rooms with oxygen,
suction, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in
order to deal with the rare emergency.

of Type II diabetes can begin so gradually that
a person may not know that they have it. Early signs are
lethargy extreme thirst, and frequent urination. Other
symptoms may include sudden weight loss, slow wound
healing, urinary tract infections, gum disease, or blurred
vision. It is not unusual for Type II diabetes to be detect-
ed while a patient is seeing a doctor about another health
concern that is actually being caused by the yet undiag-
nosed diabetes.

The primary site of drug metabolism is the liver, the
organ that plays a major role in metabolism, digestion,
detoxification, and elimination of substances from the
body. Enzymes in the liver are responsible for chemically
changing drug components into substances known as
metabolites. Metabolites are then bound to other sub-
stances for excretion through the lungs, or bodily fluids
such as saliva, sweat, breast milk, and urine, or through
reabsorption by the intestines. The primary mode of
excretion is through the kidneys.
The family of liver isoenzymes known as cytochrome
P-450 are crucial to drug metabolism. These enzymes
(labeled CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and
CYP3A4) have a catabolic action on substances, breaking
them down into metabolites. Consequently, they also act to
lower the concentration of medication in the bloodstream.
Drug interactions can occur when one drug inhibits
or induces a P-450 that acts on another drug. An exam-
ple is nicotine, a drug contained in tobacco, and known
to induce P-450s. Individuals with liver disease (e.g.,
cirrhosis) may also have insufficient levels of P-450
enzymes. As a result, the concentration of drugs metab-
olized by these enzymes (e.g., amprenavir and other
protease inhibitors) remains high and can build up to
toxic levels in the bloodstream. In addition, certain
medications and foods, such as grapefruit juice, can
inactivate or lessen the metabolic activity of P-450s.
Changing the drug dosage can alleviate the problem in
some cases.
The metabolic rate can vary significantly from per-
son to person, and drug dosages that work quickly and
effectively in one individual may not work well for
another. Factors such as genetics, environment, nutri-
tion and age also influence drug metabolism; infants
and elderly patients may have a reduced capacity to
metabolize certain drugs, and may require adjustments
in dosage.

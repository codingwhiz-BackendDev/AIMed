Cryoglobulin clumps in cold temperatures. This
physical characteristic causes people with cryoglobulin
to have symptoms during cold weather: blanching,
numbness, and pain in their fingers or toes (Raynaud’s
phenomenon); bleeding into the skin (purpura); and pain
in joints (arthralgia). People with these symptoms or any
other symptoms that appear in cold weather should be
tested for cryoglobulin.
Diseases that cause the body to make extra or abnor-
mal proteins are often associated with cryoglobulin.
These diseases include cancers involving white blood
cells, infections, autoimmune disorders, and rheuma-
toid diseases.
This test provides information about the cause of
symptoms in a person who already has a disease process.
It doesn’t diagnose a specific disease or monitor the
course of a disease.

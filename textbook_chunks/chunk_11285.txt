Erythema nodosum can be caused by many impor-
tant and treatable diseases. Among them are tuberculo-
sis, several fungal lung infections, leprosy, inflammatory
bowel disease, and some potentially dangerous bacterial
infections. Drugs can also induce erythema nodosum.
The most common are penicillin, sulfonamides, and
birth control pills.

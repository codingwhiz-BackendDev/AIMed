In some instances the family may have been referred
to a specialist in family therapy by their pediatrician or
other primary care provider. It is estimated that as many as
50% of office visits to pediatricians have to do with devel-
opmental problems in children that are affecting their fam-
ilies. Some family doctors use symptom checklists or psy-
chological screeners to assess a family’s need for therapy.
Family therapists may be either psychiatrists, clinical
psychologists, or other professionals certified by a spe-
cialty board in marriage and family therapy. They will
usually evaluate a family for treatment by scheduling a
series of interviews with the members of the immediate
family, including young children, and significant or
symptomatic members of the extended family. This
process allows the therapist(s) to find out how each mem-
ber of the family sees the problem, as well as to form first
impressions of the family’s functioning. Family therapists
typically look for the level and types of emotions
expressed, patterns of dominance and submission, the
roles played by family members, communication styles,
and the locations of emotional triangles. They will also
note whether these patterns are rigid or relatively flexible.
Preparation also usually includes drawing a geno-
gram, which is a diagram that depicts significant persons
and events in the family’s history. Genograms also
include annotations about the medical history and major
personality traits of each member. Genograms help in
uncovering intergenerational patterns of behavior, mar-
riage choices, family alliances and conflicts, the exis-
tence of family secrets, and other information that sheds
light on the family’s present situation.

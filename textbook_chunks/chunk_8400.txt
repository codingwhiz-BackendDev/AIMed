Humans may alter their usual eating habits for many
reasons, including weight loss, disease prevention or
treatment, removing toxins from the body, or to achieve a
general improvement in physical and mental health. Oth-
ers adopt special diets for religious reasons. In the case
of some vegetarians and vegans, dietary changes are
made out of ethical concerns for the rights of animals.

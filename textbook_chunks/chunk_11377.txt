The recommended dosage depends on the type of
erythromycin, the strength of the medicine, and the med-
ical problem for which it is being taken. Check with the
physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who
filled the prescription for the correct dosage.
Always take erythromycins exactly as directed.
Never take larger, smaller, more frequent, or less fre-
quent doses. To make sure the infection clears up com-
pletely, it is very important to take the medicine for as
long as it has been prescribed. Do not stop taking the
drug just because symptoms begin to improve. This is
important with all types of infections, but it is especially
important in “strep” infections, which can lead to serious
heart problems if they are not cleared up completely.
Erythromycins work best when they are at constant
levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant, take the
medicine in doses spaced evenly through the day and
night. Do not miss any doses. Some of these medicines
are most effective when taken with a full glass of water
on an empty stomach, but they may be taken with food if
stomach upset is a problem. Others work equally well
when taken with or without food. Check package direc-
tions or ask the physician or pharmacist for instructions
on how to take the medicine.

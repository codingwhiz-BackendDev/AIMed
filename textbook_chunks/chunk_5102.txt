During fetal development, folds enclose tissues and
organs and eventually fuse at the edges to form sealed
compartments. Both in the front and the back, folds
eventually become major body structures. In the back,
the entire spinal column folds in like a pipe wrapped in a
pillow. In the front, the entire lower urinary system is
folded in.
• Exstrophy of the bladder represents a failure of this
folding process to complete itself, so the organs form
with more or less of their front side missing and open to
the outside. At the same time, the front of the pelvic
bone is widely separated. The abdominal wall is open,
too. In fact, the defect often extends all the way to the
penis in the male or splits the clitoris in the female.
• A congenital bladder diverticulum represent an area of
weakness in the bladder wall through which extrudes
some of the lining of the bladder. (A small balloon
squeezed in a fist will create diverticula-like effect
between the fingers.) Bladder diverticula may be multi-
ple, and they often occur at the ureterovesical junc-
tion—the entrance of the upper urinary system into the
bladder. In this location, they may cause urine to reflux
into the ureter and kidney, leading to infection and pos-
sible kidney damage.

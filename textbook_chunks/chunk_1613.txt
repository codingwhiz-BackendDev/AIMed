Depending on the results, high catecholamine levels
can indicate different conditions and/or causes:
• High catecholamine levels can help to verify pheochro-
mocytoma, neuroblastoma, or ganglioneuroma. An aid
to diagnosis is the fact that an adrenal medullary tumor
(pheochromocytoma) secretes epinephrine, whereas gan-
glioneuroma and neuroblastoma secrete norepinephrine.
• Elevations are possible with, but do not directly confirm,
thyroid disorders, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), or
heart disease.
• Electroshock therapy, or shock resulting from hemor-
rhage or exposure to toxins, can raise catecholamine
levels.
• In the patient with normal or low baseline cate-
cholamine levels, failure to show an increase in the
sample taken after standing suggests an autonomic ner-
vous system dysfunction (the division of the nervous
system responsible for the automatic or unconscious
regulation of internal body functioning).

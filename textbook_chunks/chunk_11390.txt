Erythromycins may interact with many other medi-
cines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of the
drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be greater.
Anyone who takes erythromycins should let the physician
know all other medicines he or she is taking. Among the
drugs that may interact with erythromycins are:
• acetaminophen (Tylenol)
• medicine for overactive thyroid
• male hormones (androgens)
• female hormones (estrogens)
• other antibiotics

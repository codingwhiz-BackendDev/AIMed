Ileostomies represent about 25% of enterostomies.
They are performed after the surgeon removes a diseased
colon and sometimes the rectum as well. The most com-
mon ileostomy is called a Brooke ileostomy after the
English surgeon who developed it. In a Brooke ileosto-
my, the surgeon makes the stoma in the lower right sec-
tion of the abdomen. The ileum is pulled through an
opening (incision) in the muscle layer. The surgeon then
turns the cut end of the intestine inside out and sews it to
the edges of the hole. He or she then positions an appli-
ance for collecting the fecal material. The appliance con-
sists of a plastic bag that fits over the stoma and lies flat
against the abdomen. The patient is taught to drain the
bag from time to time during the day. Ileostomies need to
be emptied frequently because the digested food contains
large amounts of water. Shortly after the operation, the
ileostomy produces 1–2 qt (0.9–1.91) of fluid per day;
after a month or two of adjustment, the volume decreases
to 1–2 pt (0.5–0.9)per day.
KOCK POUCH (CONTINENT ILEOSTOMY). The Kock
pouch is a variation of the basic ileostomy and is named
for its Swedish inventor. In the Kock technique, the sur-
geon forms a pouch inside the abdominal cavity behind
the stoma that collects the fecal material. The stoma is
shaped into a valve to prevent fluid from leaking onto the
patient’s abdomen. The patient then empties the pouch
several times daily by inserting a tube (catheter) through
the valve. The Kock technique is sometimes called a con-
tinent ileostomy because the fluid is contained inside the
abdomen. It is successful in 70–90% of patients who
have it done.

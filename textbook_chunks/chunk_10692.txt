Endoscope, endoscopy—An endoscope used in the
field of gastroenterology is a hollow, thin, flexible
tube that uses a lens or miniature camera to view
various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. When the
procedure is performed to examine the bile ducts or
pancreas, the organs are not viewed directly, but
rather indirectly through the injection of contrast.
The performance of an exam using an endoscope is
referred to as endoscopy. Diagnosis through biop-
sies or other means and therapeutic procedures can
also be done using these instruments.
Visualization—The process of making an internal
organ visible. A radiopaque substance is intro-
duced into the body, then an x-ray picture of the
desired area is taken.
ducts, measurements using x rays are taken to determine
if the ducts are too large (dilated) or too narrow (stric-
tured). The ducts and gallbladder should be free of stones
or tumors.

DCS is treated by giving the patient oxygen and
placing him or her in a hyperbaric chamber, an enclosure
in which the air pressure is first gradually increased and
then gradually decreased. This shrinks the bubbles and
allows the nitrogen to safely diffuse out of the tissues.
Hyperbaric chamber facilities exist throughout the Unit-
ed States. No matter how mild oneâ€™s symptoms may
appear, immediate transportation to a facility is essential.

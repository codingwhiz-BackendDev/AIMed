The purpose of electroconvulsive therapy is to provide
relief from the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses
such as severe depression, mania, and schizophrenia.
ECT is indicated when patients need rapid improvement
because they are suicidal, self-injurious, refuse to eat or
drink, cannot or will not take medication as prescribed, or
present some other danger to themselves. Antidepressant
medications, while effective in many cases, may take two
to six weeks to produce a therapeutic effect. Antipsychotic
medications used to treat mania and schizophrenia have
many uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous side
effects, limiting their use. In addition, some patients devel-
op allergies and therefore are unable to take their medicine.

Do not take more than the recommended daily
dosage of guaifenesin.
Guaifenesin is not meant to be used for coughs asso-
ciated with asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or
smoking. It also should not be used for coughs that are
producing a large amount of mucus.
A lingering cough could be a sign of a serious med-
ical condition. Coughs that last more than seven days or
are associated with fever, rash, sore throat, or lasting
headache should have medical attention. Call a physi-
cian as soon as possible.
Some studies suggest that guaifenesin causes birth
defects. Women who are pregnant or plan to become
pregnant should check with their physicians before using
any products that contain guaifenesin. Whether guaifen-
esin passes into breast milk is not known, but no ill
effects have been reported in nursing babies whose moth-
ers used guaifenesin.

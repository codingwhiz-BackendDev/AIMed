X rays, computed tomography scans (CT scans),
and ultrasound are very helpful in detecting cysts. Some
cysts will develop characteristic hardening of organ tis-
sues from calcium deposits (calcifications). Blood tests
to detect antibodies are useful when positive, but up to
50% of patients have negative results. Examination of
aspirated cyst fluid for parasites can be diagnostic, but
carries the danger of a fatal allergic reaction. Treatment
with anti-parasitic medications before aspiration is
reported to decrease allergic complications and decrease
the risk of spread during the procedure.

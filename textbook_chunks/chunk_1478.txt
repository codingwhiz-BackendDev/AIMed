For otherwise healthy people, rest and over-the-
counter medications for reducing fever and discomfort
(such as acetaminophen) while waiting for the disease
to run its course are usually all that is necessary. Antibi-
otics are prescribed in some cases, particularly when
complications occur or the lymph nodes remain swollen
and painful for more than two or three months, but there
is no agreement among doctors about when and how they
should be used. If a lymph node becomes very swollen
and painful, the family doctor may decide to drain it.

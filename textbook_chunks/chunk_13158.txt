The Latin name for the disease is erythema infectio-
sum, meaning infectious redness. It is also called the
“slapped cheek disease” because, when the bright red
rash first appears on the cheeks, it looks as if the face has
been slapped. Anyone can get the disease, but it occurs
more frequently in school-aged children. The disease is
usually mild, and both children and adults usually recov-
er quickly without complications. In fact, some individu-
als exhibit no symptoms and never even feel ill. Out-
breaks most often occur in the winter and spring.

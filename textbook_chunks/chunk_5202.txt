Half of the cases of congenital lobar emphysema
occur in the first four weeks of life, and three-quarters
occur in infants less than six months old. Congenital
lobar emphysema is more common in boys than in girls.
Each person has two lungs, right and left. The right
lung is divided into three sections, called lobes, and the
left lung into two lobes. Congenital lobar emphysema
usually affects only one lobe, and this is usually an upper
lobe. It occurs most frequently in the left upper lobe, fol-
lowed by the right middle lobe.

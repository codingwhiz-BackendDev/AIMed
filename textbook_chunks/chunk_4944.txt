hockey, and boxing, are among those most likely to lead
to concussion. Other significant causes include falls, col-
lisions, or blows due to bicycling, horseback riding, ski-
ing, and soccer.
The risk of concussion from football is extremely
high, especially at the high school level. Studies show
that approximately one in five players suffer concussion
or more serious brain injury during their brief high-
school careers. The rate at the collegiate level is approxi-
mately 1 in 20. Rates for hockey players are not known
as certainly, but are believed to be similar.
Concussion and lasting brain damage is an especial-
ly significant risk for boxers, since the goal of the sport
is, in fact, to deliver a concussion to the opponent. For
this reason, the American Academy of Neurology has
called for a ban on boxing. Repeated concussions over
months or years can cause cumulative head injury. The
cumulative brain injuries suffered by most boxers can
lead to permanent brain damage. Multiple blows to the
head can cause “punch-drunk” syndrome or dementia
pugilistica, as evidenced by Muhammed Ali, whose
parkinsonism is a result of his career in the ring.
Young children are likely to suffer concussions from
falls or collisions on the playground or around the home.
Child abuse is, unfortunately, another common cause of
concussion.

The most common side effects are mild diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, stomach or abdominal pain, dizziness,
drowsiness, lightheadedness, nervousness, sleep prob-
lems, and headache. These problems usually go away as
the body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical
treatment unless they are bothersome.
More serious side effects are not common, but may
occur. If any of the following side effects occur, check
with a physician immediately:
• skin rash or other skin problems such as itching, peel-
ing, hives, or redness
• fever
• agitation or confusion
• hallucinations
• shakiness or tremors
• seizures or convulsions
• tingling of fingers or toes
• pain where the medicine was injected (lasting after the
injection)
• pain in the calves, spreading to the heels
• swelling of the calves or lower legs
• swelling of the face or neck
• swallowing problems
• rapid heartbeat
• shortness of breath
• loss of consciousness
Other rare side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking fluoroquinolones should
get in touch with his or her physician.

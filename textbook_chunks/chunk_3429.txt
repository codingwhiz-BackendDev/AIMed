High cholesterol is one of the key risk factors for
heart disease. Left untreated, too much bad cholesterol
can clog the blood vessels, leading to chest pain
(angina), blood clots, and heart attacks. Heart disease is
the number one killer of men and women in the United
States. By reducing LDL, people with heart disease may
prevent further heart attacks and strokes, prolong and
improve the quality of their lives, and slow or reverse
cholesterol build-up in the arteries. In people without
heart disease, lowering LDL can decrease the risk of a
first heart attack or stroke.

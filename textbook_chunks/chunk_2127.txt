Following an abnormal Pap test, a colposcopy is
usually performed. The physician uses a magnifying
scope to view the surface of the cervix. The cervix may
be coated with an iodine solution that causes normal cells
to turn brown and abnormal cells to turn white or yellow.
This is called a Schiller test. If any abnormal areas are
observed, a colposcopic biopsy may be performed. A
biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for micro-
scopic examination by a pathologist.
Other types of cervical biopsies may be performed.
An endocervical curettage is a biopsy in which a narrow
instrument called a curette is used to scrape tissue from
inside the opening of the cervix. A cone biopsy, or
conization, is used to remove a cone-shaped piece of tis-
sue from the cervix. In a cold knife cone biopsy, a surgi-
cal scalpel or laser is used to remove the tissue. A loop
electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is a cone
biopsy using a wire that is heated by an electrical cur-
rent. Cone biopsies can be used to determine whether
abnormal cells have invaded below the surface of the
cervix. They also can be used to treat many precancers
and very early cancers. Biopsies may be performed with
a local or general anesthetic. They may cause cramping
and bleeding.

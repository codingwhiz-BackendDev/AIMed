CMTX. Another type of CMT, called CMTX, is usu-
ally considered a subtype of CMT1 because it affects the
myelin, but it has a different type of inheritance than type
1 or type 2. In CMTX, the CMT-causing gene is located
on the X chromosome and is called connexin 32 (Cx32).
The job of this gene is to code for a class of protein called
connexins that form tunnels between the layers of myelin.
CMT2. There are at least five different genes that can
cause CMT type 2. Therefore, CMT2 has subtypes A, B,
C, D and E. As of early 2001, scientists have narrowed in
on the location of most of the CMT2 causing genes.
However, the specific genes and the mutations have not
yet been found for most types. Very recently, the gene for
CMT2E has been found. The gene is called neurofila-
ment-light (NF-L). Because it has just been discovered,
not much is known about how mutations in this gene
cause CMT.
CMT3. In the past a condition called Dejerine-Sottas
disease was referred to as CMT3. This is a severe type of
CMT in which symptoms begin in infancy or early child-
hood. It is now known that this is not a separate type of
CMT and in fact people who have onset in infancy or
early childhood often have mutations in the PMP22 or
MPZ genes.
CMT4. CMT4 is a rare type of CMT in which the
nerve conduction tests have slow response results. Howev-
er, it is classified differently from CMT1 because it is
passed through families by a different pattern of inheri-
tance. There are five different subtypes and each has only
been described in a few families. The symptoms in CMT4
are often severe and other symptoms such as deafness may
be present. There are three different genes that have been
associated with CMT4 as of early 2001. They are called
MTMR2, EGR2, and NDRG1. More research is required
to understand how mutations in these genes cause CMT.

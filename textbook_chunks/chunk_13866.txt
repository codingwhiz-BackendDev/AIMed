Individuals with high activity levels appear to be at
greater risk for fractures. This group includes children
and athletes participating in contact sports. Because of an
increase in bone brittleness with aging, elderly persons
are also included in this high-risk population. Up to the
age of 50, more men suffer from fractures than women
due to occupational hazards. However, after the age of
50, women are more prone to fractures than men. Specif-
ic diseases causing an increased risk for fractures include
Pagetâ€™s disease, rickets, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteo-
porosis, bone cancer and tumors, and prolonged disuse
of a nonfunctional body part such as after a stroke.

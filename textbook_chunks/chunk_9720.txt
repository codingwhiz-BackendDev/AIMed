Collagen is a strong, fibrous protein that lends
strength and elasticity to connective tissues such as the

skin, tendons, organ walls, cartilage, and blood vessels.
Each of these connective tissues requires collagen tai-
lored to meet its specific purposes. The many roles of
collagen are reflected in the number of genes dedicated
to its production. There are at least 28 genes in humans
that encode at least 19 different types of collagen. Muta-
tions in these genes can affect basic construction as well
as the fine-tuned processing of the collagen.
EDS was originally described by Dr. Van Meekeren
in 1682. Dr. Ehlers and Dr. Danlos further characterized
the disease in 1901 and 1908, respectively. Today,
according to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation, one
in 5,000 to one in 10,000 people are affected by some
form of EDS.
EDS is a group of genetic disorders that usually
affects the skin, ligaments, joints, and blood vessels. Clas-
sification of EDS types was revised in 1997. The new
classification involves categorizing the different forms of
EDS into six major sub-types, including classical, hyper-
mobility, vascular, kyphoscoliosis, arthrochalasia, and
dermatosparaxis, and a collection of rare or poorly
defined varieties. This new classification is simpler and
based more on descriptions of the actual symptoms.

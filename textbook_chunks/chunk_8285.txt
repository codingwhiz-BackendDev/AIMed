Good diaper hygiene will prevent or clear up many
simple cases of diaper rash. Diapers should be checked
very frequently and changed as soon as they are wet or
soiled. Good air circulation is also important for healthy
skin. Babies should have some time without wearing a
diaper, and a waterproof pad can be used to protect the
bed or other surface. Rubber pants, or other occlusive fab-
rics, should not be used over the diaper area. Some cloth-
like disposable diapers promote better air circulation than
plastic-type diapers. It may be necessary for mothers to
experiment with diaper types to see if the baby’s skin
reacts better to cloth or disposable ones. If disposable dia-
pers are used, the baby’s skin may react differently to var-
ious brands. If the baby is wearing cloth diapers, they
should be washed in a mild detergent and double rinsed.
The diaper area should be cleaned with something
mild, even plain water. Some wipes contain alcohol or
chemicals that can be irritating for some babies. Plain
water may be the best cleansing substance when there is
a rash. Using warm water in a spray bottle (or giving a
quick bath) and then lightly patting the skin dry can pro-
duce less skin trauma than using wipes. In the event of
suspected yeast, a tablespoon of cider vinegar can be
added to a cup of warm water and used as a cleansing
solution. This is dilute enough that it should not burn, but
acidifies the skin pH enough to hamper the yeast growth.
Barrier ointments can be valuable to treat rashes.
Those that contain zinc oxide are especially effective.
These creams and ointments protect already irritated skin
from the additional insult of urine and stool, particularly
if the baby has diarrhea. Cornstarch powder may be
used on rashes that are moist, such as impetigo.

A CT scan may be performed in a hospital or outpa-
tient imaging center. Although the equipment looks large
and intimidating, it is very sophisticated and fairly com-
fortable. The patient is asked to lie on a gantry, or narrow
table, that slides into the center of the scanner. The scan-
ner looks like a doughnut and is round in the middle,
which allows the x-ray beam to rotate around the patient.
The scanner section may also be tilted slightly to allow
for certain cross-sectional angles.

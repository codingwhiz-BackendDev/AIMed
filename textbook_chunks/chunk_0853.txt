Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells.
It destroys the hard-to-detect cancer cells that have
spread and are circulating in the body. Chemotherapeutic
drugs can be taken either orally (by mouth) or intra-
venously, and may be given alone or in conjunction with
surgery, radiation or both.
When chemotherapy is used before surgery or radia-
tion, it is known as primary chemotherapy or “neoadju-
vant chemotherapy.” An advantage of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy is that since the cancer cells have not been
exposed to anti-cancer drugs, they are especially vulnera-
ble. It can therefore be used effectively to reduce the size
of the tumor for surgery or target it for radiation. Howev-
er, the toxic effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are
severe. In addition, it may make the body less tolerant to
the side effects of other treatments that follow such as
radiation therapy. The more common use of chemothera-
py is adjuvant therapy, which is given to enhance the
effectiveness of other treatments For example, after
surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy is given to destroy any
cancerous cells that still remain in the body.

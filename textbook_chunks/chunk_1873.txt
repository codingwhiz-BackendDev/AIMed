The recommended dosage depends on the type of
cephalosporin. Check with the physician who prescribed
the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for
the correct dosage.
Always take cephalosporins exactly as directed by
your physician. Never take larger, smaller, more fre-
quent, or less frequent doses. Take the drug for exactly as
long as directedâ€”no more and no less. Do not save some
doses of the drug to take for future infections. The medi-
cine may not be right for other kinds of infections, even
if the symptoms are the same. In addition, take all of the
medicine to treat the infection for which it was pre-
scribed. The infection may not clear up completely if too
little medicine is taken. Taking this medicine for too
long, on the other hand, may open the door to new infec-
tions that do not respond to the drug.
Some cephalosporins work best when taken on an
empty stomach. Others should be taken after meals.
Check with the physician who prescribed the medicine or
the pharmacist who filled the prescription for instruc-
tions on how to take the medicine.

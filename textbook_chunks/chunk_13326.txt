Rapid, aggressive medical treatment, specifically,
antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement, is impera-
tive. Antibiotics may include penicillin, an aminoglyco-
side or third-generation cephalosporin, and clindamycin
or metronidazole. Analgesics are employed for pain con-
trol. During surgical debridement, dead tissue is stripped
away. After surgery, patients are rigorously monitored for
continued infection, shock, or other complications. If
available, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also be used.

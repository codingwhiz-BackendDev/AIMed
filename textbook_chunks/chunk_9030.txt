Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the
symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten-
sive damage to the body before significant symptoms
develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able
to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The
patient’s recent medical and social history may also help
in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the
patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed
recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours
before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what
was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system.
Different drugs have varying effects on the body’s
acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood
like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to
detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to
what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for
various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is
identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast
the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can
also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect
changes in the body’s chemistry. Blood and urine tests
may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a
result of the overdose.

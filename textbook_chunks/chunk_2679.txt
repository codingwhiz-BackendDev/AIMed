Chest drainage therapy is done to relieve pressure on
the lungs, and remove fluid that could promote infection.
Installing a chest drainage tube can be either an emer-
gency or a planned procedure.
Removing air or fluids from the chest involves the
insertion of a tube through the skin and the muscles
between the ribs, and into the chest cavity. This cavity is
also called the pleural space. Insertion of this tube is
called thoracostomy, and chest drainage therapy is some-
times called thoracostomy tube drainage.
Conditions that may need to be treated by chest
drainage therapy include emphysema (air in the tissues
of the lungs), tuberculosis, and spontaneous pneu-
mothorax (air in the chest cavity) that causes more
than a 25% collapse of the lung. Other conditions
include cancer that causes excessive secretions,
empyema (pus in the thoracic cavity), or hemothorax
(blood in the thoracic cavity). Almost all chest drainage
therapy is done to drain blood from the chest cavity
after lung or heart surgery. In cases where the lung is
collapsed, removing fluids by chest drainage therapy
allows the lung to reinflate.
Oftentimes an x ray is performed prior to treatment
to determine whether the problem is either fluid or air in

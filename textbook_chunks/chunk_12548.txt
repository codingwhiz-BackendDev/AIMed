Lifestyle factors such as a high-stress job, erratic work
hours, lack of social or family support, or erratic sleep pat-
terns can all cause prolonged fatigue. If stress is an issue, a
number of relaxation therapies and techniques are available
to help alleviate tension, including massage, yoga, aro-
matherapy, hydrotherapy, progressive relaxation exercis-
es, meditation, and guided imagery. Some individuals
may also benefit from individual or family counseling or
psychotherapy sessions to work through stress-related
fatigue that is a result of family or social issues.
Maintaining healthy sleep patterns is critical to prop-
er rest. Having a set “bedtime” helps to keep sleep on
schedule. A calm and restful sleeping environment is also
important to healthy sleep. Above all, the bedroom should
be quiet and comfortable, away from loud noises and with
adequate window treatments to keep sunlight and street-
lights out. Removing distractions from the bedroom such
as televisions and telephones can also be helpful.

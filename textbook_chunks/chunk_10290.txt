Heavy cigarette smoking causes about 80–90% of
all emphysema cases. However a few cases are the result
of an inherited deficiency of a substance called alpha-1-
antitrypsin (AAT). The number of Americans with this
deficiency is relatively small, probably no greater than
70,000. Pipe, cigar, and marijuana smoking can also
damage the lungs. While a person may be less likely to
inhale cigar and pipe smoke, these types of smoke can
also impair lung function. Marijuana smoke may be even
more damaging because it is inhaled deeply and held in
by the smoker.
The symptoms of emphysema develop gradually
over many years. It is a common occurrence for many
emphysema patients to have lost over half of their func-
tioning lung tissue before they become aware that some-
thing is wrong. Shortness of breath, a chronic mild cough
(which may be productive of large amounts of dark, thick
sputum, and often dismissed as “smoker’s cough”), and
sometimes weight loss are associated with emphysema.

Before the varicella vaccine (Varivax) was released
for use in 1995, virtually all of the four million children
born each year in the United States contracted chicken-
pox, resulting in hospitalization in five of every 1,000
cases and 100 deaths. Chickenpox is caused by the vari-
cella-zoster virus (a member of the herpes virus family),
which is spread through the air or by direct contact with
an infected person. Once someone has been infected with
the virus, an incubation period of about 10â€“21 days pass-
es before symptoms begin. The period during which
infected people are able to spread the disease is believed
to start one or two days before the rash breaks out and to
continue until all the blisters have formed scabs, which
usually happens fout to seven days after the rash breaks

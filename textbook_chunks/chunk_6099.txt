While people can generally cough voluntarily, a
cough is usually a reflex triggered when an irritant stim-
ulates one or more of the cough receptors found at dif-
ferent points in the respiratory system. These receptors
then send a message to the cough center in the brain,
which in turn tells the body to cough. A cough begins
with a deep breath in, at which point the opening
between the vocal cords at the upper part of the larynx
(glottis) shuts, trapping the air in the lungs. As the
diaphragm and other muscles involved in breathing
press against the lungs, the glottis suddenly opens, pro-
ducing an explosive outflow of air at speeds greater than
100 mi (160 km) per hour.
In normal situations, most people cough once or
twice an hour during the day to clear the airway of irri-
tants. However, when the level of irritants in the air is
high or when the respiratory system becomes infected,
coughing may become frequent and prolonged. It may
interfere with exercise or sleep, and it may also cause dis-
tress if accompanied by dizziness, chest pain, or breath-
lessness. In the majority cases, frequent coughing lasts
one to two weeks and tapers off as the irritant or infection
subsides. If a cough lasts more than three weeks it is con-
sidered a chronic cough, and physicians will try to deter-
mine a cause beyond an acute infection or irritant.
Coughs are generally described as either dry or pro-
ductive. A dry cough does not bring up a mixture of
mucus, irritants, and other substances from the lungs
(sputum), while a productive cough does. In the case of a
bacterial infection, the sputum brought up in a productive
cough may be greenish, gray, or brown. In the case of an
allergy or viral infection it may be clear or white. In the
most serious conditions, the sputum may contain blood.

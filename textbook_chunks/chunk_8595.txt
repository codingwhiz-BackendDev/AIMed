Universal immunization is the most effective means
of preventing diphtheria. The standard course of immu-
nization for healthy children is three doses of DPT
(diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) preparation given between
two months and six months of age, with booster doses
given at 18 months and at entry into school. Adults
should be immunized at 10 year intervals with Td
(tetanus-diphtheria) toxoid. A toxoid is a bacterial toxin
that is treated to make it harmless but still can induce
immunity to the disease.

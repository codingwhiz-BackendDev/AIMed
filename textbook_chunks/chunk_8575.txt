The diagnosis of diphtheria can be confirmed by the
results of a culture obtained from the infected area. Mater-
ial from the swab is put on a microscope slide and stained
using a procedure called Gram’s stain. The diphtheria
bacillus is called Gram-positive because it holds the dye
after the slide is rinsed with alcohol. Under the micro-
scope, diphtheria bacilli look like beaded rod-shaped cells,
grouped in patterns that resemble Chinese characters.
Another laboratory test involves growing the diphtheria
bacillus on a special material called Loeffler’s medium.

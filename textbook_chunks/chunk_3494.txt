The “normal” values for serum lipids depend on the
patient’s age, sex, and race. Normal values for people in
Western countries are usually given as 140–220 mg/dL in
adults, although as many as 5% of the population has TC
higher than 300 mg/dL. Among Asians, the figures are
about 20% lower. As a rule, both TC and LDL levels rise
as people get older.
Some doctors prefer to speak of “desired” rather
than “normal” cholesterol values, on the grounds that
“normal” refers to statistically average levels that may
still be too high for good health. Desirable values are as
follows:
• Total cholesterol (TC): less than 200 mg/dL
• HDL cholesterol: 40–70 mg/dL in males, 40–80 mg/dL
in females
• LDL cholesterol: less than 130 mg/dL
• TC/HDL ratio: under 4.0 in males, 3.8 in females.

HYPONATREMIA. Up to 1% of all hospitalized
patients develop hyponatremia, making it one of the
most common electrolyte disorders. Diuretics, certain
psychoactive drugs (i.e., fluoxetine, sertraline, haloperi-
dol), specific antipsychotics (lithium), vasopressin,
chlorpropamide, the illicit drug “ecstasy”, and other
pharmaceuticals can cause decreased sodium levels, or
hyponatremia. Low sodium levels may also be triggered
by inadequate dietary intake of sodium, excessive perspi-
ration, water intoxication, and impairment of adrenal
gland or kidney function.

Small stones (called “silent”) often do not cause any
symptoms, although they can be detected by an x ray.
Large stones are often painful and easily noticed by the
patient. Blood in the urine can also mean that a stone has
formed.
When the urine contains extremely high amounts of
cystine, yellow-brown hexagonal crystals are visible
when a sample is examined under the microscope. Urine
samples can also be mixed with chemicals that change
color when high levels of cystine are present. When the
compound nitroprusside is added to urine that has been
made alkaline by the addition of ammonia, the urine
specimen turns red if it contains excess cystine.

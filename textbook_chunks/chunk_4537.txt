Colonic irrigation is also known as hydrotherapy of
the colon, high colonic, entero-lavage, or simply colonic. It
is the process of cleansing the colon by passing several gal-
lons of water through it with the use of special equipment.
It is similar to an enema but treats the whole colon, not just
the lower bowel. This has the effect of flushing out impact-
ed fecal matter, toxins, mucous, and even parasites that
often build up over the passage of time. It is a procedure
that should only be undertaken by a qualified practitioner.

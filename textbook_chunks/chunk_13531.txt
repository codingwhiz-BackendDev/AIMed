Folic acid is also known as folate, or folacin. It is
one of the nutrients most often found to be deficient in
the Western diet, and there is evidence that deficiency is
a problem on a worldwide scale. Folic acid is found in
leafy green vegetables, beans, peas and lentils, liver,
beets, brussel sprouts, poultry, nutritional yeast, tuna,
wheat germ, mushrooms, oranges, asparagus, broccoli,
spinach, bananas, strawberries, and cantaloupes. In 1998,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required
food manufacturers to add folic acid to enriched bread
and grain products to boost intake and to help prevent
neural tube defects (NTD).

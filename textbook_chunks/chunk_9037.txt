• Elimination of the drug that has not yet been absorbed is
attempted. Vomiting may be induced using ipecac syrup
or other drugs that cause vomiting. Ipecac syrup should
not be given to patients who overdosed with tricyclic
antidepressants, theophylline, or any drug that causes a
significant change in mental status. If a patient vomits
while unconscious, there is a serious risk of choking.
• Gastric lavage, or washing out the stomach, may be
attempted. For this procedure a tube flexible tube is
inserted through the nose, down the throat, and into the
stomach. The contents of the stomach are then suc-
tioned out through the tube. A solution of saline (salt
water) is injected into the tube to rinse out the stomach.
This solution is then suctioned out. This is the process
used when someone has his/her stomach pumped.
• Activated charcoal is sometimes given to absorb the
drug.
• Medication to stimulate urination or defecation may be
given to try to flush the excess drug out of the body
faster.
• Intravenous (IV) fluids may be given. An intravenous
line, a needle inserted into a vein, may be put into the
arm or back of the hand. Fluids, either sterile saline
(salt water solution) or dextrose (sugar water solution),
can be administered through this line. Increasing fluids
can help to flush the drug out of the system and to
reestablish balance of fluids and minerals in the body.
The pH (acid/base balance) of the body may need to be
corrected by administering electrolytes like sodium,
potassium, and bicarbonate through this IV line. If
drugs need to be administered quickly, they can also be
injected directly into the IV line.
• Hemodialysis is a procedure where blood is circulated
out of the body, pumped through a dialysis machine,
then reintroduced back into the body. This process can
be used to filter some drugs out of the blood. It may

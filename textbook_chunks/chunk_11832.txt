Typically, ECMO patients have daily chest x rays
and blood work, and constant vital sign monitoring. They
are usually placed on a special rotating bed that is
designed to decrease pressure on the skin and help move
secretions from the lungs.
After the patient is stable on ECMO, the breathing
machine settings will be lowered to “rest” settings, which
allows the lungs to rest without the risk of too much oxy-
gen or pressure from the ventilator.

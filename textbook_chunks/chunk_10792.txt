A class of drugs called alpha-adrenergic blockers,
which includes phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin, relax
the muscle tissue surrounding the bladder outlet and lin-
ing the wall of the urethra to permit urine to flow more
freely. These drugs improve obstructive symptoms, but do
not keep the prostate from enlarging. Other drugs (finas-
teride is a good example) do shrink the prostate and may
delay the need for surgery. Symptoms may not, however,
improve until the drug has been used for three months or
longer. Antibiotic drugs are given promptly whenever
infection is diagnosed. Some medications, including anti-
histamines and some decongestants, can make the
symptoms of BPH suddenly worse and even cause acute
urinary retention, and therefore should be avoided.

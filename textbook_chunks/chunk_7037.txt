Uncomplicated cystitis is treated with antibiotics.
These include penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin;
sulfisoxazole or sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim;
nitrofurantoin; cephalosporins; or fluoroquinolones.
(Flouroquinolones are generally not used in children
under 18 years of age.) Treatment for women is short-
term; most patients respond within three days. Men do
not respond as well to short-term treatment and
require seven to 10 days of oral antibiotics for uncom-
plicated UTIs.
Patients of either sex may be given phenazopyridine
or flavoxate to relieve painful urination.
Trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin are preferred for
treating recurrent UTIs in women.
Over 50% of older men with UTIs also suffer
from infection of the prostate gland. Some antibiotics,
including amoxicillin and the cephalosporins, do not
affect the prostate gland. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics
or trimethoprim are the drugs of choice for these
patients.
Patients with pyelonephritis can be treated with oral
antibiotics or intramuscular doses of cephalosporins.
Medications are given for 10â€“14 days, and sometimes
longer. If the patient requires hospitalization because of
high fever and dehydration caused by vomiting, antibi-
otics can be given intravenously.

In most cases, the physician makes a midline inci-
sion along a straight line from the lowest edge of the
vaginal opening to toward the anus. In other cases, the
episiotomy is performed by making a diagonal incision
across the midline between the vagina and anus. This
method is used much less often, may be more painful,
and may require more healing time than the midline inci-
sion. After the baby is delivered through the extended
vaginal opening, the incision is closed with stitches. A
local anesthetic agent may be applied or injected to numb
the area before it is sewn up (sutured).
Several reasons are cited for performing epi-
siotomies. Some experts believe that an episiotomy
speeds up the birthing process, making it easier for the
baby to be delivered. This can be important if there is any
sign of distress that may harm the mother or baby.
Because tissues in this area may tear during the delivery,
another reason for performing an episiotomy is that a
clean incision is easier to repair than a jagged tear and
may heal faster. Although the use of episiotomy is some-
times described as protecting the pelvic muscles and pos-
sibly preventing future problems with urinary inconti-
nence, it is not clear that the procedure actually helps.
The use of episiotomy during the birthing process is
fairly widespread in the United States. Estimates of epi-
siotomy use in hospitals range from 65â€“95% of deliver-
ies, depending on how many times the mother has given
birth previously. This routine use of episiotomy is being
reexamined in many hospitals and health care settings.
However, an episiotomy is always necessary during a
forceps delivery because of the size of the forceps.

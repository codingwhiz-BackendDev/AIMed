The immune system protects against infection by
viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. After initial expo-
sure to a foreign substance, or antigen, the immune sys-
tem creates both antibodies and sensitized T cells. Both
these immune agents respond when the body is reex-
posed to the antigen. Antibodies, which are circulating
proteins, respond within minutes, to give what is termed
an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. T cellsâ€™ respons-
es occur over several days, and are thus called delayed
hypersensitivity reactions. The cascade of events initiat-
ed by the T cells leads to hardening (induration) and red-
ness (erythema) at the injection site.

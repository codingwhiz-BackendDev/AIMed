Intrahepatic cholestasis is usually caused by hepati-
tis or by medications that can produce symptoms resem-
bling hepatitis. Phenothiazine-derivative drugs, including
chlorpromazine, can cause sudden fever and inflamma-
tion. Symptoms usually disappear after use of the drug(s)
is stopped. In rare cases, a condition resembling chronic
biliary cirrhosis (a progressive disease characterized by
destruction of small bile ducts) persists even after the
medication is stopped. Some patients experience a simi-
lar reaction in response to tricyclic antidepressants
(amitriptyline, imipramine), phenylbutazone (Butazo-
lidin), erythromycin estolate (Estomycin, Purmycin), and
other drugs. Intrahepatic cholestasis may also be caused
by alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis,
cancer that has spread (metastasized) from another part
of the body, and a number of rare disorders.
Extrahepatic cholestasis is most often caused by a stone
obstructing the passage through which bile travels from the
gallbladder to the small intestine (common bile duct) or by
pancreatic cancer. Less often, the condition occurs as a result
of non-cancerous narrowing of the common duct (strictures),
ductal carcinoma, or disorders of the pancreas.
Cholestasis caused by the use of steroids causes lit-
tle, if any, inflammation. Symptoms develop gradually

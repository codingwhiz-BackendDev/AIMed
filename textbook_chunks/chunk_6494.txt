Redness, swelling, and the formation of a blister at the
site of cryotherapy are all expected results of the treatment.
A gauze dressing is applied and patients should wash the
site three or four times daily while fluid continues to ooze
from the wound, usually for five to 14 days. A dry crust
then forms that falls off by itself. Wounds on the head and
neck may take four to six weeks to heal, but those on the
body, arms, and legs can take longer. Some patients experi-
ence pain at the site following the treatment. This can usu-
ally be eased with acetaminophen (Tylenol), though in
some cases a stronger pain reliever may be required.

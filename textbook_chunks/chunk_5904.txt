Natural therapies may reduce the risk of certain
types of heart disease, but once symptoms appear, con-
ventional medical attention is necessary. A healthy diet
(including cold-water fish as a source of essential fatty
acids) and exercise, important components of conven-
tional prevention and treatment strategies, also are
emphasized in alternative approaches to coronary artery
disease. Herbal medicine has a variety of remedies that
may have a beneficial effect on coronary artery disease.
For example, ginger (Zingiber officinale) may help
reduce cholesterol. Garlic (Allium sativum), ginger, and
hot red or chili peppers are all circulatory enhancers that
can help prevent blood clots. Yoga and other bodywork,
massage, relaxation therapies, and talking therapies may
also help prevent coronary artery disease and stop, or
even reverse, the progression of atherosclerosis. Vitamin
and mineral therapy to reduce, reverse, or protect against
coronary artery disease includes chromium; calcium and
magnesium; B-complex vitamins; the anti-oxidant vita-
mins C and E; selenium; and zinc. Traditional Chinese
medicine may recommend herbal remedies, massage,
acupuncture, and dietary modification.

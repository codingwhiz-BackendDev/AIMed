ers in a single small probe, B-mode, provides a picture
of a cross section through the eye. Doppler mode
ultrasound combines B-mode with the ability to detect
and measure the flow of blood in the tiny vessels of
the eye.
As a direct treatment tool, the vibrations of high
intensity A-mode ultrasound can be used to heat and
erode tumors. The same technique can be used to con-
trol glaucoma by selectively destroying the cells which
produce the fluid that causes the internal pressure of the
eye to rise.
The procedure followed in a regular ultrasonic eye
examination is relatively simple. The patient relaxes in
a comfortable chair in a darkened room. Mild anesthetic
eye drops are administered and the head is held secure.
The ultrasonic probe, coated with a sterile gel to ensure
good contact, is lightly pressed against the eye as the
images are made. The probe may be applied to the eye-
lid or directly to the eye, as necessary. The patient feels
nothing else, and the whole office procedure takes about
15 minutes.

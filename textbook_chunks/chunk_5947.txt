The coronary stent is a relatively new tool used to
keep coronary arteries expanded, usually following a bal-
loon angioplasty. Balloon angioplasty is used in patients
with coronary artery disease. In this disease, the blood
vessels on the heart become narrow. When this happens,
the oxygen supply is reduced to the heart muscle. The
primary cause of coronary artery disease is fat deposits
blocking the arteries (atherosclerosis). In many cases,
balloon angioplasty is unsuccessful and the vessel closes
after the procedure (restenosis). By forming a rigid sup-
port, the stent can prevent restenosis and reduce the need
for coronary bypass surgery. The stent is usually a stain-
less steel mesh tube. Since the stent will be placed inside
an artery, the device comes in various sizes to match the
size of the artery.

Recent studies have been conducted to try to deter-
mine whether diet or the use of vitamins might have an
effect on the formation of cataracts in older people. The
results have been mixed, with some studies finding that
there is a connection and other studies finding none.
Much interest has been focused on the use of antioxidant
supplements as a protection against cataracts. Antioxidant
vitamins such as vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene help
the body clean-up oxygen-free radicals. Some vitamins
are marketed specifically for the eyes. Patients should
speak to their doctors about the use of such vitamins.
Smoking and alcohol intake have been implicated in
cataract formation. Some studies have determined that a
diet high in fat will increase the likelihood of cataract
formation, while an increase in foods rich in antioxidants
will reduce the incidence. More research is needed to
determine if diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, or vita-
mins have any connection to the formation of cataracts.

“Lifetime risk” is the term that cancer researchers
use to refer to the probability that an individual over the
course of a lifetime will develop cancer or die from it. In
the United States, men have a one in two lifetime risk of
developing cancer, and for women the risk is one in
three. Overall, African-Americans are more likely to
develop cancer than whites. African-Americans are also
30% more likely to die of cancer than whites.
Most cancers are curable if detected and treated at
their early stages. A cancer patient’s prognosis is affected
by many factors, particularly the type of cancer the
patient has, the stage of the cancer, the extent to which it
has metastasized and the aggressiveness of the cancer. In
addition, the patient’s age, general health status and the
effectiveness of the treatment being pursued are also
important factors.
To help predict the future course and outcome of the
disease and the likelihood of recovery from the disease,
doctors often use statistics. The five-year survival rates
are the most common measures used. The number refers
to the proportion of people with cancer who are expected
to be alive, five years after initial diagnosis, compared
with a similar population that is free of cancer. It is
important to note that while statistics can give some
information about the average survival experience of
cancer patients in a given population, it cannot be used to
indicate individual prognosis, because no two patients
are exactly alike.

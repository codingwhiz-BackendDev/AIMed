Treatment involves correcting the condition that
caused fatty liver and providing supportive care. In fatty
liver caused by alcoholism, the treatment is to give up
drinking alcohol and to eat a healthy, well balanced diet.
In fatty liver associated with pregnancy, the recommend-
ed treatment is to deliver the baby, if the pregnancy is far
enough along. Vitamin and mineral supplements along
with nutritional support may be useful.

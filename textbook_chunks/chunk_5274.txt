cardiomyopathy—Cardiomyopathy
without a known cause.
Sarcoidosis—A chronic disease that causes forma-
tion of abnormal areas containing inflammatory
cells, called granulomas, in any organ or tissue; in
the heart, large areas of the heart muscle can be
involved, causing cardiomyopathy.
Vasodilator—Any drug that relaxes blood vessel
walls.
Ventricle—One of the two lower chambers of the
heart.
Wegener’s granulomatosis—A disease usually
affecting males that causes the infiltration of inflam-
matory cells and tissue death in the lungs, kidneys,
blood vessels, heart, and other tissues.
B is the most common cause of viral congestive car-
diomyopathy.
Myocarditis can also be caused by noninfectious
disorders. For example, the conditions sarcoidosis, gran-
ulomatous myocarditis, and Wegener’s granulomatosis
cause inflammation and tissue death in the heart muscle.
Years of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can
weaken the heart muscle, leading to congestive cardiomy-
opathy. Other drugs and toxins, such as cocaine, pesti-
cides, and other chemicals, may have the same effect.
High blood pressure (hypertension) puts extra pres-
sure on blood vessels and the heart. This increased pres-
sure makes the heart work harder to pump blood, which
may thicken and damage the chamber walls.
Severe nutritional deficiencies can weaken the heart
muscle and affect its pumping ability. Certain disorders
of metabolism, including diabetes mellitus and thyroid
disorders, can also lead to congestive cardiomyopathy.
Occasionally, inflammation of the heart muscle and
congestive cardiomyopathy may develop late in pregnan-

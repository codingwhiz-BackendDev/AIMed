In nearly all patients with lung cancer, some sort of
abnormality can be seen on a chest radiograph. Hilar
masses (enlargements at that part of the lungs where ves-
sels and nerves enter) are one of the more common
symptoms as are abnormal masses and fluid buildup on
the outside surface of the lungs or surrounding areas.
Interstitial lung disease, which is a large category of dis-
orders, many of which are related to exposure of sub-
stances (such as asbestos fibers), may be detected on a
chest x ray as fiberlike deposits, often in the lower por-
tions of the lungs.

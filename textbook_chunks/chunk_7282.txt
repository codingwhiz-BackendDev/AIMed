Debridement speeds the healing of pressure ulcers,
burns, and other wounds. Wounds that contain non-living
(necrotic) tissue take longer to heal. The necrotic tissue
may become colonized with bacteria, producing an
unpleasant odor. Though the wound is not necessarily
infected, the bacteria can cause inflammation and strain
the bodyâ€™s ability to fight infection. Necrotic tissue may
also hide pockets of pus called abscesses. Abscesses can
develop into a general infection that may lead to ampu-
tation or death.

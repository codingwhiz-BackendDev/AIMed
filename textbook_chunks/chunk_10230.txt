In arterial emboli, blood flow is blocked at the junc-
tion of major arteries, most often at the groin, knee, or
thigh. Arterial emboli are generally a complication of
heart disease. An arterial embolism in the brain (cere-
bral embolism) causes stroke, which can be fatal. An
estimated 5â€“14% of all strokes are caused by cerebral
emboli. Arterial emboli to the extremities can lead to tis-
sue death and amputation of the affected limb if not
treated effectively within hours. Intestines and kidneys
can also suffer damage from emboli.

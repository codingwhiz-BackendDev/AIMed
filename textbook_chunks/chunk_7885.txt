appears to interfere with proper growth and development
of the uterus, cervix, vagina, and fallopian tubes.
In the early 1970s, there was an increase in a rare
form of cancer, clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina
and cervix. Up until that time, doctors had seen these
cancers only in elderly women. Suddenly, young women
who had the disease appeared.
This was so unusual that researchers studied these
women to see if they had anything in common. After a
great deal of questioning and examination, it was found
that they all had one factor in common. All of the young
women had been exposed to DES in utero in the early
weeks of pregnancy.
Today, it is difficult to imagine how shocking this
discovery was. Doctors had only recently recognized that
medications and exposure to chemicals during pregnancy
could cause birth defects. This was a birth defect that
had gone undetected for almost two decades.
Since then, doctors have studied DES daughters very
carefully. Fortunately, the risk of clear cell adenocarcino-
ma is actually quite low. In fact, it appears that if a DES
daughter has not developed this cancer by age 30, she
will not develop it. Since all DES daughters are now over
age 30, there should be no further cases related to DES
exposure. However, there are a number of other symp-
toms and problems associated with DES exposure.
â€¢ Cervix and vagina. DES daughters often have distinc-
tive changes of the cervix and vagina that can be seen
during a pelvic exam. These changes include a cervical
hood (a vaginal fold draped over the cervix),
cockscomb cervix (an abnormally shaped cervix), and
adenosis (glandular cells normally located within the
cervix that appear on the outside of the cervix and in
the vagina).

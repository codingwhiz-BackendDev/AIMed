DiGeorge syndrome are diabetes (a condition where the
pancreas no longer produces enough insulin) in the
mother and fetal alcohol syndrome (a pattern of birth
defects and learning and behavioral problems affecting
individuals whose mothers consumed alcohol during
pregnancy).
The loss of the genes in the deleted material means
that the baby’s third and fourth pharyngeal pouches fail
to develop normally during the twelfth week of pregnan-
cy. This developmental failure results in a completely or
partially absent thymus gland and parathyroid glands. In
addition, 74% of fetuses with DiGeorge syndrome have
severe heart defects. The child is born with a defective
immune system and an abnormally low level of calcium
in the blood.
These defects usually become apparent within 48
hours of birth. The infant’s heart defects may lead to heart
failure, or there may be seizures and other evidence of a
low level of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia).

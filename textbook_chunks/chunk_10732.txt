Endoscope, Endoscopy—An endoscope as used in
the field of gastroenterology is a thin flexible tube
which uses a lens or miniature camera to view
various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. When
the procedure is performed to examine certain
organs such as the bile ducts or pancreas, the
organs are not viewed directly, but rather indirect-
ly through the injection of x-ray dye. The perfor-
mance of an exam using an endoscope is referred
by the general term endoscopy. Diagnosis through
biopsies or other means and therapeutic proce-
dures can be done with these instruments.
NSAIDS—This abbreviation stands for non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are med-
ications such as Ibufprofen that are used to control
pain and inflammation. Most may be purchased
over the counter. One of their major side effects is
that they decrease the effect of the normal blood
clotting factors in blood. In patients undergoing
surgical or endoscopic procedures, this can lead
to an increased risk of bleeding.

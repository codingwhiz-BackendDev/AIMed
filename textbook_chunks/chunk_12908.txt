Physicians agree that the most effective treatment
for a fever is to address its underlying cause, such as
through the administration of antibiotics. Also, because
a fever helps the immune system fight infection, it usual-
ly should be allowed to run its course. Drugs to lower
fever (antipyretics) can be given if a patient (particularly
a child) is uncomfortable. These include aspirin, aceta-
minophen (Tylenol), and ibuprofin (Advil). Aspirin,
however, should not be given to a child or adolescent
with a fever since this drug has been linked to an
increased risk of Reye’s syndrome. Bathing a patient in
cool water can also help alleviate a high fever.
A fever requires emergency treatment under the fol-
lowing circumstances:
• newborn (three months or younger) with a fever over
100.5°F (38°C)
• infant or child with a fever over 103°F (39.4°C)
• fever accompanied by severe headache, neck stiffness,
mental confusion, or severe swelling of the throat

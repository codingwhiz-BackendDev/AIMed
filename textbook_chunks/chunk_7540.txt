DHT is quite safe for virtually all people. There is
no risk of infection from the agents injected, since they
are purified antigens, not whole organisms. Life threaten-
ing, hypersensitive reactions (anaphylaxis) are a very
small risk; patients should notify the administering
physician immediately if signs of wheezing, swelling, or
diffuse redness of the skin develops.

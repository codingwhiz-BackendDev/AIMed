There are three reasons why people choke. These are:
• mechanical obstruction
• tissue swelling
• crushing of the trachea
Regardless of the cause, choking cuts off the air sup-
ply to the lungs. Indications that a person’s airway is
blocked include:
• the person cannot speak or cry out
• the person’s face turns blue from lack of oxygen
• the person desperately grabs at his or her throat

Birth asphyxia significant enough to result in CP is
now uncommon in developed countries. Tight nuchal
cord (umbilical cord around the babyâ€™s neck) and pro-
lapsed cord (cord delivered before the baby) are possible
causes of birth asphyxia, as are bleeding and other com-
plications associated with placental abruption and pla-
centa previa (placenta lying over the cervix).
Infection in the mother is sometimes not passed to
the fetus through the placenta, but is transmitted to the
baby during delivery. Any such infection that results in
serious illness in the newborn has the potential to pro-
duce some neurological damage.

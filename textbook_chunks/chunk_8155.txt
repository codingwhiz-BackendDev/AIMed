Diagnosis requires the demonstration of hyper-
glycemia, hyperketonemia, and acidosis. DKA is estab-
lished if the patient’s urine or blood is strongly positive
for glucose and ketones. Normal glucose levels in a non-
diabetic person on average range from 80–110 mg/dl. A
person with diabetes will typically fluctuate outside
those parameters. DKA glucose levels exceed 250 mg/dl
and can reach 400 to 800 mg/dL. A low serum bicarbon-
ate level (usually below 15 mEq/L) is also present,
indicative of acidosis.
A blood test or urinalysis can quickly determine
the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. Test
strips are available to patients commercially can sub-
merge in urine to detect the presence or concentration
of ketones.

None

The results for current or recent infection are:
• antibody to EA = positive
• antibody to VCA IgM = positive
• antibody to VCA IgG = positive
• antibody to EBNA = negative
Without the pattern of the three antibodies, it can be
difficult to be accurate in interpretation. The presence of
antibody to VCA IgM is the best single test for current or
recent first time infection.

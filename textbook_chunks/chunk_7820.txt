Patient education in the form of therapy or self-help
groups is crucial for training patients with depressive dis-
orders to recognize symptoms of depression and to take
an active part in their treatment program. Extended main-
tenance treatment with antidepressants may be required
in some patients to prevent relapse. Early intervention
with children with depression is effective in arresting
development of more severe problems.

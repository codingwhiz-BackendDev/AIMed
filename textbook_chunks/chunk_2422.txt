Haemophilus ducreyi is spread from person to per-
son by vaginal, anal, and oral sexual contact. Uncircum-
cised men are about three times more likely than circum-
cised men to become infected following exposure to
Haemophilus ducreyi. Having unprotected sex, exchang-
ing sex for drugs, and having unprotected sex with a
prostitute are other risk factors. Many cases of chancroid
in the United States occur in persons who had traveled to
countries where the disease is more common.
Chancroid occurs when Haemophilus ducreyi pene-
trates the skin through an injury, like a scratch or cut.
Once past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, and
nutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. The first sign of
chancroid is a small, red papule that occurs within three
to seven days following exposure to the bacteria, but may
take up to one month. Usually within one day, the papule
becomes an ulcer. The chancroid ulcer is painful, bleeds
easily, drains a grey or yellowish pus, and has sharply
defined, ragged edges. They can vary in size from an
eighth of an inch to two inches in diameter. Men usually
have only one ulcer, but women often have four or more.
Sometimes “kissing” ulcers occur when one ulcer
spreads the bacterial infection to an opposite skin sur-
face. For example, kissing ulcers can form on the lips of
the labia majora. Alternatively, women may not have any
external sores but may experience painful urination,
intercourse, and/or bowel movements and may have a
vaginal discharge or rectal bleeding.
Signs that the infection has spread to the lymph node
appear about one week after the formation of the genital
ulcer. Lymph nodes are small organs in the lymphatic
system that filter waste materials from nearly every
organ in the body. This lymph node infection is called
“lymphadenitis” and the swollen, painful lymph node is
called a “bubo.” The bubo, which appears as a red, spher-
ical lump, may burst through the skin, releasing a thick
pus and forming another ulcer.

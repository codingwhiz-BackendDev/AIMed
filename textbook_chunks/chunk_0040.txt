PLEASE READ—IMPORTANT INFORMATION
The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 (GEM2) is a
one-stop source for medical information on nearly 1,700
common medical disorders, conditions, tests, and treat-
ments, including high-profile diseases such as AIDS,
Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and heart attack. This ency-
clopedia avoids medical jargon and uses language that
laypersons can understand, while still providing thor-
ough coverage of each topic. The Gale Encyclopedia of
Medicine 2 fills a gap between basic consumer health
resources, such as single-volume family medical guides,
and highly technical professional materials.

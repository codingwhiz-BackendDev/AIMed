Because idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy does
not have a known cause, there is no sure way to prevent
it. The best way to prevent congestive cardiomyopathy is
to avoid known causes such as drinking excess alcohol or
taking toxic drugs. Eating a nutritious diet and getting
regular exercise to improve overall fitness also can help
the heart to stay healthy.
Congestive cardiomyopathy may also be prevented by
identifying and treating any conditions that might damage
the heart muscle. These include high blood pressure and
coronary artery disease. Regular blood pressure checks
and obtaining immediate medical care for hypertension
and symptoms of coronary artery disease, such as chest
pain, are important to keep the heart functioning properly.
Finally, diagnosing and treating congestive car-
diomyopathy before the heart becomes severely damaged
may improve the outlook.

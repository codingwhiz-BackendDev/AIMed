Before fixed contractures develop, muscle-relaxant
drugs such as diazepam (Valium), dantrolene (Dantri-
um), and baclofen (Lioresal) may be prescribed. Botu-
linum toxin (Botox), a newer and highly effective treat-
ment, is injected directly into the affected muscles. Alco-
hol or phenol injections into the nerve controlling the
muscle are another option. Multiple medications are
available to control seizures, and athetosis can be treated
using medications such as trihexyphenidyl HCl (Artane)
and benztropine (Cogentin).

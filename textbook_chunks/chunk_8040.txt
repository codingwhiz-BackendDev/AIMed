Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that causes
serious health complications including renal (kidney)
failure, heart disease, stroke, and blindness. Approxi-
mately 14 million Americans (about 5% of the popula-
tion) have diabetes. Unfortunately, as many as one-half
are unaware that they have it.

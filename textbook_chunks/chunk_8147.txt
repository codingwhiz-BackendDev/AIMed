Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) always results from a
severe insulin deficiency. Insulin is the hormone secret-
ed by the body to lower the blood sugar levels when
they become too high. Diabetes mellitus is the disease
resulting from the inability of the body to produce or
respond properly to insulin, required by the body to
convert glucose to energy. In childhood diabetes, DKA
complications represent the leading cause of death,
mostly due to the accumulation of abnormally large
amounts of fluid in the brain (cerebral edema). DKA
combines three major features: hyperglycemia, mean-
ing excessively high blood sugar kevels hyperketone-
mia, meaning an overproduction of ketones by the
body; and acidosis, meaning that the blood has become
too acidic.
Insulin deficiency is responsible for all three condi-
tions: the body glucose goes largely unused since most
cells are unable to transport glucose into the cell without
the presence of insulin; this condition makes the body
use stored fat as an alternative source instead of the
unavailable glucose for energy, a process that produces
acidic ketones, which build up because they require
insulin to be broken down. The presence of excess
ketones in the bloodstream in turn causes the blood to
become more acidic than the body tissues, which creates
a toxic condition.

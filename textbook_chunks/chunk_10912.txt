Tube enterostomies are operations in which the sur-
geon makes a stoma into the stomach itself or the
jejunum in order to insert a tube for liquid nutrients.
Tube enterostomies are performed in patients who need
tube feeding for longer than six weeks, or who have had
recent mouth or nose surgery. As long as the patient’s
intestinal tract can function, tube feedings are consid-
ered preferable to intravenous feeding. Enteral nutrition
is safer than intravenous fluids and helps to keep the
patient’s digestive tract functioning.

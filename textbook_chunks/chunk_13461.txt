species of parasitic flatworms (Trematodes) that have
complex life cycles involving hosts other than human
beings. Trematode comes from a Greek word that means
having holes and refers to the external suckers that adult

infections are contracted by eating uncooked fish, plants,
or animals from fluke-infected waters. Symptoms vary
according to the type of fluke infection.

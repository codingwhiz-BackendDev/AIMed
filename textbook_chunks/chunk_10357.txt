Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain, usually
caused by a direct viral infection or a hypersensitivity
reaction to a virus or foreign protein. Brain inflammation
caused by a bacterial infection is sometimes called
cerebritis. When both the brain and spinal cord are
involved, the disorder is called encephalomyelitis. An
inflammation of the brainâ€™s covering, or meninges, is
called meningitis.

ENDOSCOPIC TECHNIQUES. An endoscope is a thin
flexible tube that uses a lens or mirror to look at various
parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic retro-
grade cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can accu-
rately determine the cause and site of blockage. It also
has the advantage of being able to treat the cause of
obstruction, by removing stones and dilating (stretching)
strictures. ERCP involves the injection of x-ray dye into
the bile ducts through an endoscope. Endoscopic ultra-
sound is another endoscopic alternative, but is not as
available as ERCP and is not therapeutic.

doctors diagnose conditions that may make a c-section
necessary. Ultrasound testing reveals the positions of the
baby and the placenta and may be used to estimate the
baby’s size and gestational age. Fetal heart monitors, in
use since the 1970s, transmit any signals of fetal distress.
Oxygen deprivation may be determined by checking the
amniotic fluid for meconium (feces)—a lack of oxygen
causes an unborn baby to defecate. Oxygen deprivation
may also be determined by testing the pH of a blood
sample taken from the baby’s scalp; a pH of 7.25 or high-
er is normal, between 7.2 and 7.25 is suspicious, and
below 7.2 is a sign of trouble.
When a c-section is being considered because labor
is not progressing, the mother should first be encouraged
to walk around to stimulate labor. Labor may also be
stimulated with the drug oxytocin.
When a c-section is being considered because the
baby is in a breech position, the doctor may first attempt
to reposition the baby; this is called external cephalic

Emergency splinting may be required to immobilize
the body part or parts involved. When fracture repair is
necessary, the procedure is often performed in a hospital
but can also be successfully done in an outpatient surgi-
cal facility, doctor’s office or emergency room. Before
any surgery for fracture repair, blood and urine studies
may be taken from the patient. X rays may follow this if
not previously acquired. It has been noted however, that
not all fractures are immediately apparent on an initial
x-ray examination. In this case, where a fracture is defi-
nitely suspected the extent of the fracture can be properly
diagnosed by repeating the x rays 10–14 days later.
Depending upon the situation, local or general anesthesia
may be used for fracture repair.

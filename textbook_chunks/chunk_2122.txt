Most women do not have symptoms of cervical can-
cer until it has become invasive. At that point, the symp-
toms may include:
• unusual vaginal discharge
• light vaginal bleeding or spots of blood outside of nor-
mal menstruation
• pain or vaginal bleeding with sexual intercourse
• post-menopausal vaginal bleeding
Once the cancer has invaded the tissue surrounding
the cervix, a woman may experience pain in the pelvic
region and heavy bleeding from the vagina.

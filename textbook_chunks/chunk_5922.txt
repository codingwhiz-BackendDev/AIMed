Do not smoke or use tobacco. Smoking has many
adverse effects on the heart. It increases the heart rate,
constricts major arteries, and can create irregular heart-
beats. It raises blood pressure, contributes to the develop-
ment of plaque, increases the formation of blood clots,
and causes blood platelets to cluster and impede blood
flow. Heart damage caused by smoking can be repaired
by quitting. Even heavy smokers can return to heart
health. Several studies have shown that ex-smokers face
the same risk of heart disease as non-smokers within five
to 10 years after they quit.
Drink in moderation. Modest consumption of alco-
hol may actually protect against coronary artery disease
because alcohol appears to raise levels of HDL (“good”)
cholesterol. The American Heart Association defines
moderate consumption as one ounce of alcohol per day,
roughly one cocktail, one 8-ounce glass of wine, or two
12-ounce glasses of beer. However, even moderate drink-
ing can increase risk factors for heart disease for some
people (by raising blood pressure, for example). Exces-
sive drinking is always bad for the heart. It usually raises
blood pressure and can poison the heart and cause abnor-
mal heart rhythms or even heart failure.
Do not use other recreational drugs. Commonly used
recreational drugs, particularly cocaine and “crack,” can
seriously harm the heart and should never be used.

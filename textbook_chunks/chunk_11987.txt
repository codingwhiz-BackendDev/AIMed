VISUAL ACUITY. The refraction will determine the
refractive status for each eye for distance and for near. A
prescription for glasses is made after taking many things
into consideration. The eye doctor may alter a prescrip-
tion based upon many factors. Different materials for
glasses may be suggested. For example, polycarbonate
may be suggested for children or people active in sports
because it is very impact resistant. Bifocals, trifocals,
single-vision spectacles, and contact lenses are also
options.
VISUAL FIELDS. A normal visual field extends about
60째 upward, about 75째 downward, about 65째 toward the
nose, and about 100째 toward the ear and has one blind
spot close to the center. Defects in the visual field signify
damage to the retina, optic nerve, or the neurological
visual pathway.
Seeing clearly does not necessarily mean the eyes
are healthy or that the eyes are working together as a
team. Regular checkups can detect abnormalities, hope-
fully before a problem arises. The eye doctor can suggest
ways to help protect the eyes and vision (e.g., safety gog-
gles, ultraviolet (UV) coatings on lenses). A person
should also have an eye exam if they notice a change in
vision, eyestrain, blur, flashes of light, a sudden onset of
floaters (little dots), distortion of objects, double vision,
redness, pain or discharge.

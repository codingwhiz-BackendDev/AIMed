Oral medications are available to lower blood glucose
in Type II diabetics. The drugs first prescribed for Type II
diabetes are in a class of compounds called sulfonylureas
and include tolbutamide, tolazamide, acetohexamide, and
chlorpropamide. Newer drugs in the same class are now
available and include glyburide, glimeperide, and glip-
izide. The way that these drugs work is not well under-
stood, however, they seem to stimulate cells of the pan-
creas to produce more insulin. New medications that are
available to treat diabetes include metformin, acarbose,
and troglitizone. The choice of the right medication
depends in part on the individual patient profile. All drugs
have side effects that may make them inappropriate for
particular patients. Some for example, may stimulate
weight gain or cause stomach irritation, so they may not be
the best treatment for someone who is already overweight
or who also has stomach ulcers. While these medications
are an important aspect of treatment for Type II diabetes,
they are not a substitute for a well planned diet and moder-
ate exercise. Oral medications are not effective for Type I
diabetes, in which the patient produces little or no insulin.

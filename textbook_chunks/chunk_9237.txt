Dysfunctional uterine bleeding often occurs when
the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, is stimulated to
grow by the hormone estrogen. When exposure to estro-
gen is extended, or not balanced by the presence of prog-
esterone, the endometrium continues to grow until it out-
grows its blood supply. Then it sloughs off, causing
irregular bleeding. If the bleeding is heavy enough and
frequent enough, anemia can result.
Menorrhagia is representative of DUB. It is caused
by many conditions including some outside the repro-
ductive system. Causes of menorrhagia include:
• adenomyosis (a benign condition characterized by
growths in the area of the uterus)
• imbalance between the hormones estrogen and proges-
terone
• fibroid tumors
• pelvic infection
• endometrial cancer (cancer of the inner mucous
membrane of the uterus)
• endometrial polyps
• endometriosis (a condition in which endometrial or
endrometrial-like tissue appears outside of its normal
place in the uterus)
• use of an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception
• hypothyroidism
• blood clotting problems (rare)
• lupus erythematosus
• pelvic inflammatory disease
• steroid therapy
• advanced liver disease
• renal (kidney) disease
• chemotherapy (cancer treatment with chemicals)
To diagnose dysfunctional uterine bleeding, many of
the potential causes mentioned above must be eliminat-
ed. When all potential causes connected with pregnancy,
infection, and tumors (benign or malignant) are eliminat-
ed, then menorrhagia is presumed to be caused by dys-
functional uterine bleeding.

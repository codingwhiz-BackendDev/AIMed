None

There are no complications or side effects of this
test. However, the results of a CEA study should be inter-
preted with caution. A single test result may not yield
clinically useful information. Several studies over a peri-
od of months may be needed.
Another concern is the potential for false positive as
well as false negative results. A false positive result
means the test shows an abnormal value when cancer is
not present. A false negative means the test reveals a nor-
mal value when cancer actually is present.

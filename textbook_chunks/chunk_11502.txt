Unfortunately, symptoms generally donâ€™t appear
until the tumor has grown so large that the patient cannot
be cured. Dysphagia (trouble swallowing or a sensation
of having food stuck in the throat or chest) is the most
common symptom. Swallowing problems may occur
occasionally at first, and patients often react by eating
more slowly and chewing their food more carefully and,
as the tumor grows, switching to soft foods or a liquid
diet. Without treatment, the tumor will eventually pre-
vent even liquid from passing into the stomach. A sensa-
tion of burning or slight mid-chest pressure is a rare,
often-disregarded symptom of esophageal cancer.
Painful swallowing is usually a symptom of a large
tumor obstructing the opening of the esophagus. It can
lead to regurgitation of food, weight loss, physical wast-
ing, and malnutrition. Anyone who has trouble swal-
lowing, loses a significant amount of weight without
dieting, or cannot eat solid food because it is too painful
to swallow should see a doctor.

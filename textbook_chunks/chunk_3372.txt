Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in animal tis-
sue and is an important component to the human body. It
is manufactured in the liver and carried throughout the
body in the bloodstream. Problems can occur when too
much cholesterol forms an accumulation of plaque on
blood vessel walls, which impedes blood flow to the
heart and other organs. The highest cholesterol content is
found in meat, poultry, shellfish, and dairy products.

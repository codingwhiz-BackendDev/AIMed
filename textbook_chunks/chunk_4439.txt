Colic, which is not a disease, affects 10–20% of all
infants. It is more common in boys than in girls and most
common in a family’s first child. Symptoms of colic usu-
ally appear when a baby is 14–21 days old, reach a
crescendo at the age of three months, and disappear with-
in the next eight weeks. Episodes occur frequently but
intermittently and usually begin with prolonged periods
of crying in the late afternoon or evening. They can last
for just a few minutes or continue for several hours.
Some babies who have colic are simply fussy. Others cry
so hard that their faces turn red, then pale.

Regular insulin is fast-acting and starts to work within
15–30 minutes, with its peak glucose-lowering effect
about two hours after it is injected. Its effects last for about
four to six hours. NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) and
Lente insulin are intermediate-acting, starting to work
within one to three hours and lasting up to 18–26 hours.
Ultra-lente is a long-acting form of insulin that starts to
work within four to eight hours and lasts 28–36 hours.
Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be caused by
too much insulin, too little food (or eating too late to
coincide with the action of the insulin), alcohol con-
sumption, or increased exercise. A patient with symp-
toms of hypoglycemia may be hungry, cranky, confused,
and tired. The patient may become sweaty and shaky.
Left untreated, the patient can lose consciousness or have
a seizure. This condition is sometimes called an insulin
reaction and should be treated by giving the patient
something sweet to eat or drink like a candy, sugar cubes,
juice, or another high sugar snack.

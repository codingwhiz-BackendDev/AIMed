Causes of colon cancer are probably environmental
in the sporadic cases (80%) and genetic in the heredity
predisposed cases (20%). Since malignant cells have a
changed genetic makeup, this means that in 80% of
cases, the environment spontaneously induces change,
whereas in those born with a genetic predisposition, they
are either destined to get the cancer or it will take less
environmental exposure to induce the cancer. Exposure
to agents in the environment that may induce mutation is
the process of carcinogenesis and is caused by agents
known as carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). Specific
carcinogens have been difficult to identify; however,
dietary factors seem to be involved.
Colon cancer is more common in industrialized
nations and diets high in fat, red meat, total calories, and
alcohol seem to predispose. Diets high in fiber are asso-
ciated with a decreased risk. The mechanism for protec-
tion by high-fiber diets may be related to less exposure of
the colon lining to carcinogens from the environment, as
the transit time through the bowel is faster with a high-
fiber diet than it is with a low-fiber diet.
Age plays a definite role in the predisposition to
colon cancer. Colon cancer is uncommon before age 40.
This incidence increases substantially after age 50 and
doubles with each succeeding decade.
There is also a slight increase risk for colon cancer
in the individual who smokes.
Patients who suffer from inflammatory diseases of
the colon known as ulcerative colitis and Crohnâ€™s colitis
are also at increased risk.

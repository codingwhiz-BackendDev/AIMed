The word “cellulitis” actually means “inflammation
of the cells.” Specifically, cellulitis refers to an infection
of the tissue just below the skin surface. In humans, the
skin and the tissues under the skin are the most common
locations for microbial infection. Skin is the first defense
against invading bacteria and other microbes. An infec-
tion can occur when this normally strong barrier is dam-
aged due to surgery, injury, or a burn. Even something as
small as a scratch or an insect bite allows bacteria to enter
the skin, which may lead to an infection. Usually, the
immune system kills any invading bacteria, but some-
times the bacteria are able to grow and cause an infection.
Once past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, and
nutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. Disease-causing
bacteria release proteins called enzymes which cause tis-
sue damage. The body’s reaction to damage is inflamma-
tion which is characterized by pain, redness, heat, and
swelling. This red, painful region grows bigger as the
infection and resulting tissue damage spread. An untreat-
ed infection may spread to the lymphatic system (acute
lymphangitis), the lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), the
bloodstream (bacteremia), or into deeper tissues. Celluli-
tis most often occurs on the face, neck, and legs.

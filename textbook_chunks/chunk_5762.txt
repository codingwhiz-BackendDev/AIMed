The doctor will take a case history to try to deter-
mine the cause of the ulcer. This can include improper
use of contact lenses; injury, such as a scratch from a
twig; or severe dry eye. An instrument called a slit lamp
will be used to examine the cornea. The slit lamp is a
microscope with a light source that magnifies the cornea,
allowing the extent of the ulcer to be seen. Fluorescein, a
yellow dye, may be used to illuminate further detail. If a
germ is responsible for the ulcer, identification may
require scraping samples directly from the cornea, con-
junctiva, and lids, and sending them to the laboratory.

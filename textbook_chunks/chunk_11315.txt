accumulate, causing hyperbilirubinemia, a condition in
which the baby becomes jaundiced. The jaundice is
apparent from the yellowish tone of the baby’s eyes and
skin. If hyperbilirubinemia cannot be controlled, the
baby develops kernicterus. The term kernicterus means
that bilirubin is being deposited in the brain, possibly
causing permanent damage.
Other symptoms that may be present include high
levels of insulin and low blood sugar, as well as a condi-
tion called hydrops fetalis. Hydrops fetalis is character-
ized by an accumulation of fluids within the baby’s body,
giving it a swollen appearance. This fluid accumulation
inhibits normal breathing, because the lungs cannot
expand fully and may contain fluid. If this condition con-
tinues for an extended period, it can interfere with lung
growth. Hydrops fetalis and anemia can also contribute
to heart problems.

The benefits of EDTA chelation for the treatment of
lead poisoning and excessively high calcium levels are
undisputed. The claims of benefits for those suffering
from atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and other
degenerative diseases are more difficult to prove. Report-
ed uses for chelation therapy include treatment of angi-
na, gangrene, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s
disease, psoriasis, and Alzheimer’s disease. Improve-
ment is also claimed for people experiencing diminished
sight, hearing, smell, coordination, and sexual potency.

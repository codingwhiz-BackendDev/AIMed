All electrolyte tests can be performed on plasma or
serum. Plasma is prepared by withdrawing a blood sam-
ple and placing it in a test tube containing a chemical that
prevents blood from clotting (an anticoagulant). Serum is
prepared by withdrawing a blood sample, placing it in a
test tube, and allowing it to clot. The blood spontaneously
clots within a minute of withdrawing the blood from a
vein. The serum or plasma is then rapidly spun with a
centrifuge in order to remove the blood cells or clot.

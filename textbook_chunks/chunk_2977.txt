Another sign that labor is beginning is the breaking
of the “bag of waters,” the amniotic sac which had cush-
ioned the baby during the pregnancy. When it breaks, it
releases water in a trickle or a gush. Only about 10% of
women actually experience this water flow in the begin-
ning of labor, however. Most of the time, the rupture
occurs sometime later in labor. If the amniotic sac doesn’t
rupture on its own, the doctor will break it during labor.
Some women have diarrhea or nausea as labor
begins. Others notice a sudden surge of energy and the
urge to clean or arrange things right before labor begins;
this is known as “nesting.”

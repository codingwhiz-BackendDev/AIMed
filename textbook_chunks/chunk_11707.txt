Significant health benefits are obtained by including a
moderate amount of physical exercise in the form of an
exercise prescription. This is much like a drug prescription
in that it also helps enhance the health of those who take it
in the proper dosage. Physical activity plays a positive role
in preventing disease and improving overall health status.
People of all ages, both male and female, benefit from reg-
ular physical activity. Regular exercise also provides signif-
icant psychological benefits and improves quality of life.

An echocardiogram may show a number of abnor-
malities in the structure and function of the heart, such as:
• thickening of the wall of the heart muscle (especially
the left ventricle)
• abnormal motion of the heart muscle
• blood leaking backward through the heart valves
(regurgitation)
• decreased blood flow through a heart valve (stenosis)

As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be
required to sign a consent form after the procedure is
explained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, along
with various x rays and an electrocardiograph (EKG),
may be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. If possi-
ble, the patient should visit an enterostomal therapist,
who will mark an appropriate place on the abdomen for
the stoma, and offer pre-operative education on ostomy
management.
In order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient
may be placed on a low residue diet for several days prior
to surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for at least the
day before surgery, with nothing by mouth after mid-
night. A series of enemas and/or oral preparations
(GoLytely or Colyte) may be ordered to empty the bowel
of stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin,
or kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacte-
ria in the intestine and help prevent post-operative infec-
tion. A nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose to the
stomach on the day of surgery or during surgery to
remove gastric secretions and prevent nausea and vom-
iting. A urinary catheter (a thin plastic tube) may also be
inserted to keep the bladder empty during surgery, giving
more space in the surgical field and decreasing chances
of accidental injury.

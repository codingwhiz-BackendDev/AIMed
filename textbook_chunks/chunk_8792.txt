Diuretics are used to treat the buildup of excess fluid
in the body that occurs with some medical conditions
such as congestive heart failure, liver disease, and kid-
ney disease. Some diuretics are also prescribed to treat
high blood pressure. These drugs act on the kidneys to
increase urine output. This reduces the amount of fluid in
the bloodstream, which in turn lowers blood pressure.

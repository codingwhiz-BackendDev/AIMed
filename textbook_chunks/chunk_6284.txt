Skeletal muscles—Muscles which move the skele-
ton. All of the muscles under voluntary control are
skeletal muscles.
Smooth muscles—Muscles that surround the lin-
ings of the digestive system, airways, and circula-
tory system.
skeletal muscle contraction, the daily production of crea-
tine, and the following product, creatinine, depends on
muscle mass, which fluctuates very little.
Creatinine is excreted entirely by the kidneys, and
therefore is directly related to renal function. When the
kidneys are functioning normally, the serum creatinine
level should remain constant and normal. Slight increas-
es in creatine levels can appear after meals, especially
after ingestion of large quantities of meat, and some diur-
nal variation may occur, with a low point at 7 A.M. and a
peak at 7 P.M. Serious renal disorders, such as glomeru-
lonephritis, pyelonephritis, and urinary obstruction,
will cause abnormal elevations.
The creatinine level is interpreted in conjunction
with another kidney function test called the Blood Urea
Nitrogen (BUN). The serum creatinine level has much
the same significance as the BUN but tends to rise later.
Because of this, determinations of creatinine help to
chronicle a disease process. Generally, a doubling of cre-
atinine suggests a 50% reduction in kidney filtration rate.

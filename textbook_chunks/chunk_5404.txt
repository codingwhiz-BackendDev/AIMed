Constipation usually results from not getting enough
exercise, not drinking enough water, or from a diet that
does not include an adequate amount of fiber-rich foods
like beans, bran cereals, fruits, raw vegetables, rice, and
whole-grain breads.
Other causes of constipation include anal fissure (a
tear or crack in the lining of the anus); chronic kidney
failure; colon or rectal cancer; depression; hypercal-
cemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood);
hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland); illness
requiring complete bed rest; irritable bowel syndrome;
and stress.

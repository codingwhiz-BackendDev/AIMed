Tests that measure the concentration of electrolytes
are useful in the emergency room and to obtain clues for
the diagnosis of specific diseases. Electrolyte tests are
used for diagnosing dietary deficiencies, excess loss of
nutrients due to urination, vomiting, and diarrhea, or
abnormal shifts in the location of an electrolyte within
the body. When an abnormal electrolyte value is detect-
ed, the physician may either act to immediately correct
the imbalance directly (in the case of an emergency) or
run further tests to determine the underlying cause of the
abnormal electrolyte value. Electrolyte disturbances can
occur with malfunctioning of the kidney (renal failure),
infections that produce severe and continual diarrhea or
vomiting, drugs that cause loss of electrolytes in the
urine (diuretics), poisoning due to accidental consump-
tion of electrolytes, or diseases involving hormones that
regulate electrolyte concentrations.

Electrolytes are ionized molecules found throughout
the blood, tissues, and cells of the body. These mole-
cules, which are either positive (cations) or negative
(anions), conduct an electric current and help to balance
pH and acid-base levels in the body. Electrolytes also
facilitate the passage of fluid between and within cells
through a process known as osmosis and play a part in
regulating the function of the neuromuscular, endocrine,
and excretory systems.

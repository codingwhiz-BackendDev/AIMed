Another issue that has received much attention is
assisted suicide (euthanasia). In 1997, the State of Ore-
gon placed the issue on the ballot, amid much consterna-
tion and dispute. Perhaps the main reason euthanasia has
become front page news is because Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a
pathologist from Michigan, is one of its most vocal advo-
cates. The issue highlights the many new problems gen-
erated by increasing ability to intervene effectively in the
final moments of life and unnaturally prolong the process
of dying. The public appearance of euthanasia has also
stimulated discussion about more compassionate care of
the dying.

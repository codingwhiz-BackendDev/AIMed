Cysts of Cryptosporidia mature in the intestine and
bile ducts within three to five days of ingestion. As noted,
large-scale infections from contaminated water supplies
has been documented. However, human to human trans-
mission (such as occurs in day care centers or through
sexual behavior) is also an important cause.
Many individuals can be infected without any ill-
ness, but the major symptom is diarrhea, which is often
watery and incapacitating. Dehydration, low-grade
fever, nausea, and abdominal cramps are frequent.
In those with a normal immune system, the disease
usually lasts about 10 days. For patients with altered immu-
nity (immunocompromised), the story is quite different,
with diarrhea becoming chronic, debilitating, and even fatal.

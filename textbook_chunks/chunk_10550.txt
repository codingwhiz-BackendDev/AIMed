Although alternative and complementary therapies are
used by many cancer patients, very few controlled studies
on the effectiveness of such therapies exist. Mind-body
techniques, such as prayer, biofeedback, visualization,
meditation, and yoga, have not shown any effect in reduc-
ing cancer, but they can reduce stress and lessen some of
the side effects of cancer treatments. Clinical studies of
hydrazine sulfate found that it had no effect on cancer and
even worsened the health and well-being of the study sub-
jects. One clinical study of the drug amygdalin (Laetrile)
found that it had no effect on cancer. Laetrile can be toxic
and has caused deaths. Shark cartilage, although highly
touted as an effective cancer treatment, is an improbable
therapy that has not been the subject of clinical study.
The American Cancer Society has found that the
“metabolic diets” pose serious risk to the patient. The
effectiveness of the macrobiotic, Gerson, and Kelley diets
and the Manner metabolic therapy has not been scientifi-
cally proven. The FDA was unable to substantiate the anti-
cancer claims made about the popular Cancell treatment.
There is no evidence for the effectiveness of most
over-the-counter herbal cancer remedies. Some herbals
have shown an anticancer effect. As shown in clinical
studies, Polysaccharide krestin, from the mushroom
Coriolus versicolor, has significant effectiveness against
cancer. In a small study, the green alga Chlorella
pyrenoidosa has been shown to have anticancer activity.
In a few small studies, evening primrose oil has shown
some benefit in the treatment of cancer.

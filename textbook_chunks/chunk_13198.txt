The disease is diagnosed by taking a patient history,
performing a physical examination, and by screening
blood specimens for specific proteins produced by the
immune system in response to this infection (antibodies).
Early diagnosis may be difficult because, in the first
stages, the disease mimics other bacterial skin infections.
To make an accurate diagnosis, the physician looks for a
pattern of inflammation and signs of lymphatic obstruc-
tion, together with the patientâ€™s possible exposure to
filariasis in an area where filariasis is common. The lar-
vae (microfilariae) can also be found in the blood, but
because mosquitos, which spread the disease, are active
at night, the larvae are usually only found in the blood
between about 10 pm and 2 am.

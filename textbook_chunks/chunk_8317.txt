Prior to insertion, the inside of the dome and the rim
are covered with a thick layer (perhaps a tablespoon) of a
spermicide that is compatible with the diaphragm being
used. The domed area covers the opening into the uterus
(cervix) and keeps the spermicide in place. As a result,
any sperm that might get under the diaphragm will be
destroyed.
Diaphragms may be inserted two to three hours prior
to intercourse, and must be left in place for six to eight
hours following sexual relations. During this time the
woman may not swim, bathe, or douche, but she may
shower. If she desires to have intercourse again before
the six to eight hours have passed, the diaphragm should
not be removed. Instead, an applicator full of spermicide
should be deposited into the vagina.
A diaphragm will last for a year or more. It should
be examined weekly for holes. This can be done by hold-
ing it up to the light or filling it with water.

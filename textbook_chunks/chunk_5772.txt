Attentive care of contact lenses will greatly reduce
the incidence of corneal damage and ulceration. Germs
that cause no problems in the mouth or on the hands can
damage the eye, so contact lens wearers must wash their
hands before touching their lenses and must not use sali-
va to moisten them. Tap water should not be used to rinse
the lenses. Contacts should be removed whenever there
is irritation and left out until the eyes are back to normal.
It is not advisable to wear contact lenses while swim-
ming or in hot tubs. Daily wear contact lenses have been
found to be less of a risk than contacts for overnight wear
(extended wear). Organisms have been cultured from
contact lens cases, so the cases should be rinsed in hot
water and allowed to air dry. Cases should be replaced
every three months. Patients should follow their doctors’
schedules for replacement of the contacts.
Eye protection in the workplace, or wherever tiny
particles are flying around, is essential. Ultraviolet (UV)
coatings on glasses or sunglasses can help protect the
eyes from the sun’s rays. Goggles with UV protection
should be worn when skiing or in suntanning salons to
protect against UV rays. Prompt attention to any red eye
should prevent progressive damage.

Treatment depends on the type of fracture, its severi-
ty, the individualâ€™s age and general health. The first prior-
ity in treating any fracture is to address the entire medical
status of the patient. Medical personnel are trained not
allow a painful, deformed limb to distract them from
potentially life-threatening injury elsewhere or shock. If
an open fracture is accompanied by serious soft tissue
injury, it may be necessary to control bleeding and the
shock that can accompany loss of blood.

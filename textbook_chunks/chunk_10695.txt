When areas in the pancreatic or bile ducts (including
those in the liver) are too wide or too narrow compared
with the standard, the test is considered abnormal. Once
these findings are demonstrated using ERCP, symptoms
are usually present; they generally do not change without
treatment. Stones, identified as opaque or solid structures
within the ducts, are also considered abnormal. Masses
or tumors may also be seen, but sometimes the diagnosis
is made not by direct visualization of the tumor, but by
indirect signs, such as a single narrowing of one of the
ducts. Overall, ERCP has an excellent record in diagnos-
ing these abnormalities.

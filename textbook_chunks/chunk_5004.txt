Treating conduct disorder requires an approach that
addresses both the child and his environment. Behavioral
therapy and psychotherapy can help a child with CD to
control his anger and develop new coping skills. Family
group therapy may also be effective in some cases. Par-
ents should be counseled on how to set appropriate limits
with their child and be consistent and realistic when dis-
ciplining. If an abusive home life is at the root of the con-
duct problem, every effort should be made to move the
child into a more supportive environment. Parent training
programs are increasing in number.
For children with coexisting ADHD, substance
abuse, depression, or learning disorders, treating these
conditions first is preferred, and may result in a signifi-
cant improvement to the CD condition. In all cases of
CD, treatment should begin when symptoms first appear.
Recent studies have shown Ritalin to be a useful drug for
both ADHD and CD.
When aggressive behavior is severe, mood stabi-
lizing medication, including lithium (Cibalith-S,
Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid, Lithonate, Lithotabs), car-
bamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol),
and propranolol
(Inderal), may be an appropriate option for treating the
aggressive symptoms. However, placing the child into
a structured setting or treatment program such as a psy-
chiatric hospital may be just as beneficial for easing
aggression as medication.

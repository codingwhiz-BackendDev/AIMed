CAH is an inherited disorder. It is a recessive dis-
ease, which means that a child must inherit one copy of
the defective gene from each parent who is a carrier;
when two carriers have children, each pregnancy carries
a 25% risk of producing an affected child.
In females, CAH produces an enlarged clitoris at
birth and masculinization of features as the child grows,
such as deepening of the voice, facial hair, and failure to
menstruate or abnormal periods at puberty. Females
with severe CAH may be mistaken for males at birth. In
males, the genitals are normal at birth, but the child
becomes muscular, the penis enlarges, pubic hair
appears, and the voice deepens long before normal
puberty, sometimes as early as two to three years of age.
In the severe salt-wasting form of CAH, newborns
may develop symptoms shortly after birth, including
vomiting, dehydration, electrolyte (a compound such as
sodium or calcium that separates to form ions when dis-
solved in water) changes, and cardiac arrhythmia.
In the mild form of CAH, which occurs in late child-
hood or early adulthood, symptoms include premature
development of pubic hair, irregular menstrual periods,
unwanted body hair, or severe acne. However, some-
times there are no symptoms.

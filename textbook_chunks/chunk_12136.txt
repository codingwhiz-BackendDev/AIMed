Patients with swollen eyelids should contact their
eye doctor. A severely swollen lid can press on the eye
and possibly increase the intraocular pressure. An infec-
tion needs to be ruled out. Or, something as simple as an
allergy to nail polish and then touching the eyes can
cause swelling. The best treatment for allergic eyelid
edema is to find and remove the substance causing the
allergy. When that is not possible, as in the case of plant
allergens, cold compresses and immunosuppresesive
drugs such as corticosteroid creams are helpful. Howev-
er, steroids can cause cataracts and increase intraocular
pressure and patients must be very careful not to get the
cream in their eyes. This should not be done unless under
a doctorâ€™s care. For edema caused by trichinosis, the
trichinosis must be treated.

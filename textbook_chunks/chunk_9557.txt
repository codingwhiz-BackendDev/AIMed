Echocardiography is a diagnostic test that uses ultra-
sound waves to create an image of the heart muscle.
Ultrasound waves that rebound or echo off the heart can
show the size, shape, and movement of the heartâ€™s valves
and chambers as well as the flow of blood through the
heart. Echocardiography may show such abnormalities
as poorly functioning heart valves or damage to the heart
tissue from a past heart attack.

Good lid hygiene is very important. Regular eyelid
washing with baby shampoo helps prevent styes, cha-
lazia, blepharitis, and eyelid edema. To avoid these prob-
lems, itâ€™s also important to refrain from touching and
rubbing the eyes and eyelids, especially with hands that
have not just been washed.
Blepharitis is associated with dandruff, which is
caused by a kind of bacteria that is one of the causes of
blepharitis. Controlling dandruff by washing the hair,
scalp, and eyebrows with shampoo containing selenium
sulfide to kill the bacteria helps control the blepharitis.
When using anything near the eyes, it is important to
read the label or consult with a doctor first.
Avoiding allergens helps prevent allergic eyelid
edema. Staying inside as much as possible when pollen
counts are high and eliminating the use of, or at least
removing eye makeup thoroughly, or using hypo-aller-
genic makeup may help if the person is sensitive to those
substances.
Sunscreen, UV-blocking sunglasses, and wide brim-
med hats can help prevent eyelid tumors.
Entropian and ectropian seem to be unpreventable.

At birth, the newborn’s blood is comprised of
60%–90% of fetal hemoglobin. The fetal hemoglobin
then rapidly decreases to 2% or less after the second to
fourth years. By the time of adulthood, only traces (0.5%
or less) are found in the bloodstream.
In some diseases associated with abnormal hemo-
globin production (see Hemoglobinopathy, below), fetal
hemoglobin may persist in larger amounts. When this
occurs, the elevation raises the question of possible
underlying disease.

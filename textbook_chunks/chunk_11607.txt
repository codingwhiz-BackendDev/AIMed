EGD is performed to evaluate or treat symptoms
relating to the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as:
• upper abdominal or chest pain
• nausea or vomiting
• difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
• bleeding from the upper intestinal tract
• anemia (low blood count). EGD can be used to treat
certain conditions, such as an area of narrowing or
bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract
Upper endoscopy is more accurate than x rays for
detecting inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. It is used to
diagnose early cancer and can frequently determine
whether a growth is benign (not cancerous) or malignant
(cancerous).
Biopsies (small tissue samples) of inflamed or “sus-
picious” areas can be obtained and examined by a pathol-
ogist. Cell scrapings can also be taken by the introduc-
tion of a small brush; this helps in the diagnosis of cancer
or infections.
When treating conditions in the upper gastrointesti-
nal tract, small instruments are passed through the endo-
scope that can stretch narrowed areas (strictures), or
remove swallowed objects (such as coins or pins). In
addition, bleeding from ulcers or vessels can be treated
by a number of endoscopic techniques.
Recent studies have shown the usefulness of endo-
scopic removal of early tumors of the esophagus or stom-
ach. This is done either with injection of certain materi-
als (like alcohol), or with the use of instruments (like
lasers) that burn the tumor. Other techniques combining
medications and lasers also show promise.

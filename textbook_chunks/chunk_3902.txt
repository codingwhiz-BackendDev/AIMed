Cirrhosis changes the structure of the liver and the
blood vessels that nourish it. The disease reduces the
liver’s ability to manufacture proteins and process hor-
mones, nutrients, medications, and poisons.
Cirrhosis gets worse over time and can become
potentially life threatening. This disease can cause:
• excessive bleeding (hemorrhage)
• impotence
• liver cancer
• coma due to accumulated ammonia and body wastes
(liver failure)

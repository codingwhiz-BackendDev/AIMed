Family therapy is often recommended in the follow-
ing situations:
• Treatment of a family member with schizophrenia or
multiple personality disorder (MPD). Family therapy
helps other family members understand their relative’s
disorder and adjust to the psychological changes that
may be occurring in the relative.
• Families with problems across generational boundaries.
These would include problems caused by parents shar-
ing housing with grandparents, or children being reared
by grandparents.
• Families that deviate from social norms (common-law
relationships, gay couples rearing children, etc.). These
families may not have internal problems but may be
troubled by outsiders’ judgmental attitudes.
• Families with members from a mixture of racial, cultur-
al, or religious backgrounds.
• Families who are scapegoating a member or undermin-
ing the treatment of a member in individual therapy.
• Families where the identified patient’s problems seem
inextricably tied to problems with other family members.
• Blended families with adjustment difficulties.
Most family therapists presuppose an average level
of intelligence and education on the part of adult mem-
bers of the family.

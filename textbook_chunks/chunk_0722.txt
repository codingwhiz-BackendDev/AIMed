Antibiotic—A medication that is designed to kill or
weaken bacteria.
Anti-motility medications—Medications such as
loperamide (Imodium), dephenoxylate (Lomotil), or
medications containing codeine or narcotics which
decrease the ability of the intestine to contract. This
can worsen the condition of a patient with dysen-

Fluoroquinolones—A relatively new group of anti-
biotics that have had good success in treating infec-

effect on bone growth.
Food-borne illness—A disease that is transmitted by
eating or handling contaminated food.
Gram-negative—Refers to the property of many
bacteria that causes them to not take up color with
Gram’s stain, a method which is used to identify
bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria which take up the
stain turn purple, while Gram-negative bacteria
which do not take up the stain turn red.
Guillain-Barré syndrome—Progressive and usually
reversible paralysis or weakness of multiple muscles
usually starting in the lower extremities and often
ascending to the muscles involved in respiration.
The syndrome is due to inflammation and loss of
the myelin covering of the nerve fibers, often asso-
ciated with an acute infection.
Meninges—Outer covering of the spinal cord and
brain. Infection is called meningitis, which can lead
to damage to the brain or spinal cord and even
death.
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)—A liquid prepa-
ration developed by the World Health Organization
that can decrease fluid loss in persons with diar-
rhea. Originally developed to be prepared with
materials available in the home, commercial prepa-
rations have recently come into use.
Stool—Passage of fecal material; a bowel move-

sists longer in about 20% of cases. At least 10% will have

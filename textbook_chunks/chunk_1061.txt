Since canker sores heal by themselves, treatment is
not usually necessary. Pain relief remedies, such as topi-
cal anesthetics, may be used to reduce the pain of the
sores. The use of corticosteroid ointments sometimes
speeds healing. Avoidance of spicy or acidic foods can
help reduce the pain associated with canker sores.

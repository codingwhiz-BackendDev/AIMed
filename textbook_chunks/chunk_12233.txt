Failure to thrive (FTT) is used to describe a delay in
a childâ€™s growth or development. It is usually applied to
infants and children up to two years of age who do not
gain or maintain weight as they should. Failure to thrive
is not a specific disease, but rather a cluster of symptoms
which may come from a variety of sources.

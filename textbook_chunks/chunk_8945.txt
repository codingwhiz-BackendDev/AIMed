Diagnosis is usually suspected at birth, when the
characteristic physical signs of Down syndrome are
noted. Once this suspicion has been raised, genetic test-
ing (chromosome analysis) can be undertaken in order to
verify the presence of the disorder. This testing is usually
done on a blood sample, although chromosome analysis
can also be done on other types of tissue, including skin.
The cells to be studied are prepared in a laboratory.
Chemical stain is added to make the characteristics of the
cells and the chromosomes stand out. Chemicals are
added to prompt the cells to go through normal develop-
ment, up to the point where the chromosomes are most
visible, prior to cell division. At this point, they are
examined under a microscope and photographed. The
photograph is used to sort the different sizes and shapes
of chromosomes into pairs. In most cases of Down syn-
drome, one extra chromosome 21 will be revealed. The
final result of such testing, with the photographed chro-
mosomes paired and organized by shape and size, is
called the individualâ€™s karyotype.

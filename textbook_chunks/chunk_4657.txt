A colostomy is a surgical procedure in which a portion of the large intestine, or colon, is brought through the abdominal wall
to carry feces out of the body.There are three types of colostomies: end colostomy, double-barrel colostomy, and loop
colostomy.The loop colostomy is featured in the illustration above. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
for color and amount of wound drainage. The nasogastric
tube will remain in place, attached to low intermittent
suction until bowel activity resumes. For the first 24–48
hours after surgery, the colostomy will drain bloody
mucus. Fluids and electrolytes are infused intravenously
until the patient’s diet is can gradually be resumed, begin-
ning with liquids. Usually within 72 hours, passage of gas
and stool through the stoma begins. Initially the stool is
liquid, gradually thickening as the patient begins to take
solid foods. The patient is usually out of bed in 8–24
hours after surgery and discharged in 2–4 days.
A colostomy pouch will generally have been placed
on the patient’s abdomen, around the stoma, during
surgery. During the hospital stay, the patient and his or
her caregivers will be educated on how to care for the
colostomy. Determination of appropriate pouching sup-
plies and a schedule of how often to change the pouch
should be established. Regular assessment and meticu-
lous care of the skin surrounding the stoma is important
to maintain an adequate surface on which to apply the
pouch. Some patients with colostomies are able to rou-
tinely irrigate the stoma, resulting in regulation of bowel
function; rather than needing to wear a pouch, these
patients may need only a dressing or cap over their
stoma. Often, an enterostomal therapist will visit the
patient at home after discharge to help with the patient’s
resumption of normal daily activities.

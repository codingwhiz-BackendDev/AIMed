This medicine may cause seizures (convulsions),
especially in people with a history of seizures. Anyone
who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or
do anything else that might be dangerous if they have had
a seizure.
Epoetin helps the body make new red blood cells, but
it cannot do its job unless there is plenty of iron in the
body. The physician may recommend taking iron supple-
ments or certain vitamins that help get iron into the body.
Follow the physicianâ€™s orders to make sure the body has
enough iron for this medicine to work. Do not take iron
supplements unless they are prescribed by a physician.
In studies of laboratory animals, epoetin taken dur-
ing pregnancy caused birth defects, including damage
to the bones and spine. However, the drug has not been
reported to cause problems in human babies whose
mothers take it. Women who are pregnant or who may
become pregnant should check with their physicians for
the most up-to-date information on the safety of taking
this medicine during pregnancy.
People with certain medical conditions may have
problems if they take this medicine. For example, the
chance of side effects may be greater in people with high
blood pressure, heart or blood vessel disease or a history
of blood clots. Epoetin may not work properly in people
who have bone problems or sickle cell anemia.

usually involves a combination of modalities
(multimodality approach) and numerous specialists are
typically involved in the treatment planning process.
Therapeutic planning usually involves meticulous coor-
dination with the treatment team.
Surgery can be utilized for palliation after careful
evaluation and planning. The use of surgery in these cases
may reduce the tumor bulk and help improve the quality of
life by relieving pain, alleviating obstruction, or control-
ling bleeding. Radiotherapy for terminal cancer patients
can also alleviate pain, bleeding, and obstruction of neigh-
boring areas. Chemotherapy may be helpful to reduce
tumor size and provide some reduction to metastatic dis-
ease. Long-term chemotherapy patients develop drug
resistance, a situation that renders chemotherapeutic treat-
ments ineffective. If this occurs patients are usually given
a second line medication or, if admission criteria are met,
they may participate in an experimental research protocol.
Palliative treatments and terminal cancer in combination
can cause many symptoms that can become problematic.
These symptoms commonly include pain, nausea, vomit-
ing, difficulty in breathing, constipation, dehydration,
agitation, and delirium. The palliative treatment-planning
goal focuses to reduce these symptoms.

• Fibroadenomas. These are tumors that form in the tis-
sues outside the milk ducts. The cause of fibroadeno-
mas is unknown. They generally feel smooth and firm,
with a somewhat rubber-like texture. Typically a
fibroadenoma is not attached to surrounding tissue and
moves slightly when touched. They are most common-
ly found in adolescents and women in their early twen-
ties but can occur at any age.
• Fibrosis. Sometimes one area of breast tissue persistently
feels thicker or more prominent than the rest of the breast.
This feeling may be caused by old hardened scar tissue
and/or dead fat tissue as a result of surgery or trauma.
Often the cause of this type of breast tissue is unknown.
• Miscellaneous disorders. A number of other benign
(noncancerous) breast problems may be placed under
the heading of “fibrocystic condition.” These problems
include disorders that may lead to breast inflammation
(mastitis), infection, and/or nipple discharge.

the spinal cord, facilitating movements such as turning
the head or bending the neck. As people age, disks gradu-
ally become tougher and more unyielding. Disks also
shrink with age, which reduces the amount of padding
between the vertebrae.
As the amount of padding shrinks, the spine loses
stability. The vertebrae react by constructing osteo-
phytes, commonly known as bone spurs. There are seven
vertebrae in the neck; development of osteophytes on
these bones is sometimes called cervical osteoarthritis.
Osteophytes may help to stabilize the degenerating back-
bone and help protect the spinal cord.
By age 50, 25–50% of people develop cervical spondy-
losis; by 75 years of age, it is seen in at least 70% of people.
Although shrunken vertebral disks, osteophyte growth, and
other changes in their cervical spine may exist, many of
these people never develop significant problems.
However, about 50% of people over age 50 experience
neck pain and stiffness due to cervical spondylosis. Of
these people, 25–40% have at least one episode of cervical
radiculopathy, a condition that arises when osteophytes
compress nerves between the vertebrae. Another potential
problem occurs if osteophytes, degenerating disks, or shift-
ing vertebrae narrow the spinal canal. This pressure com-
presses the spinal cord and its blood vessels, causing cervi-
cal spondylitic myelopathy, a disorder in which large seg-
ments of the spinal cord are damaged. This disorder affects
fewer than 5% of people with cervical spondylosis. Symp-
toms of both cervical spondylitic myelopathy and cervical
radiculopathy may be present in some people.

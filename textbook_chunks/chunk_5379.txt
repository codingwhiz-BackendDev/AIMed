Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva, a thin,
delicate membrane that covers the eyeball and lines the
eyelid. It may be caused by a viral infection, such as a cold
or acute respiratory infection, or by such diseases as
measles, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster. (Illustration by

• If medication is prescribed, finish the course of antibi-
otics, as directed, to make sure that the infection is
cleared up and does not recur.
• Avoid contact, such as vigorous physical activities,
with other persons until symptoms resolve.

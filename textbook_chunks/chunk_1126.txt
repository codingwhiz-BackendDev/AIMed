Immediate treatment for CO poisoning is to remove
the victim from the source of carbon monoxide gas and
get him or her into fresh air. If the victim is not breathing
and has no pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) should be started. Depending on the severity of
the poisoning, 100% oxygen may be given with a tight
fitting mask as soon as it is available.
Taken with other symptoms of CO poisoning, COHb
levels of over 25% in healthy individuals, over 15% in
patients with a history of heart or lung disease, and over
10% in pregnant women usually indicate the need for
hospitalization. In the hospital, fluids and electrolytes are
given to correct any imbalances that have arisen from the
breakdown of cellular metabolism.
In severe cases of CO poisoning, patients are given
hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This treatment involves plac-
ing the patient in a chamber breathing 100% oxygen at a
pressure of more than one atmosphere (the normal pres-
sure the atmosphere exerts at sea level). The increased
pressure forces more oxygen into the blood. Hyperbaric
facilities are specialized, and are usually available only at
larger hospitals.

another fragment resulting from a compressive force.
Overriding is a term used to describe bony fragments
that overlap and shorten the total length of a bone.
Angulated fragments result in pieces of bone being at
angles to each other. A displaced bony fragment occurs
from disruption of normal bone alignment with deformi-
ty of these segments separate from one another. An
avulsed fragment occurs when bone fragments are
pulled from their normal position by forceful muscle
contractions or resistance from ligaments. Segmental
fragmented positioning occurs if fractures in two adja-
cent areas occur, leaving an isolated central segment. An
example of segmental alignment is when the arm bone
fractures in two separate places, with displacement of
the middle section of bone.

Dementia is usually caused by degeneration in the
cerebral cortex, the part of the brain responsible for
thoughts, memories, actions and personality. Death of
brain cells in this region leads to the cognitive impair-
ment which characterizes dementia.
The most common cause of dementia is AD,
accounting for half to three quarters of all cases. The
brain of a person with AD becomes clogged with two
abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles and
senile plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted masses
of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. Senile
plaques are composed of parts of neurons surrounding a
group of proteins called beta-amyloid deposits. Why
these structures develop is unknown. Current research
indicates possible roles for inflammation, blood flow
restriction, and toxic molecular fragments known as free
radicals. Several genes have been associated with higher
incidences of AD, although the exact role of these genes
is still unknown.
Vascular dementia is estimated to cause from 5–30%
of all dementias. It occurs from decrease in blood flow to
the brain, most commonly due to a series of small strokes
(multi-infarct dementia). Other cerebrovascular causes
include: vasculitis from syphilis, Lyme disease, or sys-
temic lupus erythematosus; subdural hematoma; and
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Because of the usually sud-
den nature of its cause, the symptoms of vascular demen-
tia tend to begin more abruptly than those of Alzheimer’s
dementia. Symptoms may progress stepwise with the
occurrence of new strokes. Unlike AD, the incidence of
vascular dementia is lower after age 75.

Caffeine may cause problems for people with certain
medical conditions or who are taking certain medicines.
ALLERGIES. Anyone with allergies to foods, dyes,
preservatives, or to the compounds aminophylline,
dyphylline, oxtriphylline, theobromine, or theophylline
should check with a physician before using caffeine.
Anyone who has ever had an unusual reaction to caffeine
should also check with a physician before using it again.
PREGNANCY. Caffeine can pass from a pregnant
woman’s body into the developing fetus. Although there
is no evidence that caffeine causes birth defects in peo-
ple, it does cause such effects in laboratory animals given
very large doses (equal to human doses of 12–24 cups of
coffee a day). In humans, evidence exists that doses of
more than 300 mg of caffeine a day (about the amount of
caffeine in 2–3 cups of coffee) may cause miscarriage or
problems with the baby’s heart rhythm. Women who take
more than 300 mg of caffeine a day during pregnancy
are also more likely to have babies with low birth
weights. Any woman who is pregnant or planning to
become pregnant should check with her physician before
using caffeine.
BREASTFEEDING. Caffeine passes into breast milk
and can affect the nursing baby. Nursing babies whose
mothers use 600 mg or more of caffeine a day may be
irritable and have trouble sleeping. Women who are
breastfeeding should check with their physicians before
using caffeine.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Caffeine may cause
problems for people with these medical conditions:
• peptic ulcer
• heart arrhythmias or palpitations

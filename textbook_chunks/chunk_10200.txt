The drug of choice in treating lymphatic filariasis is
diethylcarbamazine (DEC). The trade name in the United
States is Hetrazan.
The treatment schedule is typically 2 mg/kg per day,
three times a day, for three weeks. The drug is taken in
tablet form.
DEC kills the microfilariae quickly and injures or
kills the adult worms slowly, if at all. If all the adult
worms are not killed, remaining paired males and
females may continue to produce more larvae. There-
fore, several courses of DEC treatment over a long
time period may be necessary to rid the individual of
the parasites.
DEC has been shown to reduce the size of enlarged
lymph nodes and, when taken long-term, to reduce ele-
phantiasis. In India, DEC has been given in the form of a
medicated salt, which helps prevent spread of the disease.

Diagnosis of a specific type of infection is depen-
dant upon the characteristics of the particular strain of
the organism.
E. coli O157:H7 (HUS)
This particular strain of E. coli is suspected when
bloody diarrhea, bloody stools, lack of fever, elevated
leukocyte count, and abdominal tenderness are present.
Stool cultures are used to tentatively identify the bacteria.
Unfortunately, cultures are often negative or inconclusive
if done after 48 hours of symptoms. Further tests are usu-
ally needed, however, for confirmation of infection. This
may include a full blood count, blood film, and tests to
determine urea, electrolyte, and LDH (lactate dehydroge-
nase) levels. Damaged red blood cells, and elevated levels
of creatinine, urea, and LDH with a drop in platelet
count may indicate that HUS will develop. Immunomag-
netic separation is now being used for diagnosis as well.
E. coli non-O157 (VTEC)

None

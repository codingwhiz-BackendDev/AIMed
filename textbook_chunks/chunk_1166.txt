A single abnormal CEA value may be significant,
but must be regarded cautiously. In general, very high
CEA levels indicate more serious cancer, with a poorer
chance for cure. But some benign diseases and certain
cancer treatments may produce an elevated CEA test.
Cigarette smoking will also cause the CEA level to be
abnormally high.

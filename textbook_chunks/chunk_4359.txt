Many patients who undergo cognitive-behavioral
therapy successfully learn how to replace their mal-
adaptive thoughts and behaviors with positive ones that
facilitate individual growth and happiness. Cognitive-
behavioral therapy may be used in conjunction with
pharmaceutical and other treatment interventions, so
overall success rates are difficult to gauge. However,
success rates of 65% or more have been reported with
cognitive-behavioral therapy alone as a treatment for
panic attacks and agoraphobia. Relapse has been report-
ed in some patient populations, perhaps due to the brief
nature of the therapy, but follow-up sessions can put
patients back on track.

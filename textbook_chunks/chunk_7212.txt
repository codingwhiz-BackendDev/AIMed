Tears drain into little openings (puncta) in the inner
corners of the eyelids. From there, the tears travel
through little tube-like structures (canaliculi) to the
lacrimal sac. The nasolacrimal ducts then take the tears
from the lacrimal sac to the nose. Thatâ€™s why people
need to blow their nose when they cry a lot.
Dacryocystitis is usually caused by a blockage of
the nasolacrimal duct, which allows fluid to drain into
the nasal passages. When the lacrimal sac does not
drain, bacteria can grow in the trapped fluid. This con-
dition is most common in infants and people over 40
years old.

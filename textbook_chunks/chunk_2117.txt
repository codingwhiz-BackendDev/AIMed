cancer, the risk factor begins to increase in the late teens.
Rates for carcinoma in situ peak between the ages of 20
and 30. In the United States, the incidence of invasive
cervical cancer increases rapidly with age for African
American women over the age of 25. The incidence rises
more slowly for Caucasian women. However, women
over age 65 account for more than 25% of all cases of
invasive cervical cancer.
The incidence of cervical cancer is highest among
poor women and among women in developing countries.
In the United States, the death rates from cervical cancer
are higher among Hispanic, Native American, and
African American women than among Caucasian
women. These groups of women are much less likely to
receive regular Pap tests. Therefore, their cervical can-
cers usually are diagnosed at a much later stage, after the
cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

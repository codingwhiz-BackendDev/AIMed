Failure to thrive may also result from lack of avail-
able food or the quality of the food offered. This can be
due to economic factors in the family, parental beliefs and
concepts of nutrition, or neglect of the child. In addition,
if the baby is being breast fed, the quality or quantity of
the motherâ€™s milk may be the source of the problem.
Psychosocial problems, often stemming from a lack
of nurturing parent-child relations can lead to a failure to
thrive. The child may exhibit poor appetite due to depres-
sion from insufficient attention from parents.
Infants and toddlers, whose growth is substantially
less than expected, are considered to be suffering from
FTT.

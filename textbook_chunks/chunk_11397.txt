The erythropoietin (EPO) test is used to determine if
hormonal secretion is causing changes in the red blood
cells. The test has great value in evaluating low hemoglo-
bin (anemia), and another disorder called polycythemia,
in which unusually large numbers of red blood cells are
found in the blood. The EPO test is also used to identify
kidney tumors and to evaluate abuse by athletes who
believe commercially prepared erythropoietin enhances
performance.

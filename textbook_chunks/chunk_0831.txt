cancer has to be weighed against the side effects of the
treatment. If the cancer is very aggressive and a cure is
not possible, then the treatment should be aimed at
relieving the symptoms and controlling the cancer for as
long as possible.
Cancer treatment can take many different forms, and
it is always tailored to the individual patient. The deci-
sion on which type of treatment is the most appropriate
depends on the type and location of cancer, the extent to
which it has already spread, the patientâ€™s age, sex, gener-
al health status and personal treatment preferences. The
major types of treatment are: surgery, radiation, chemo-
therapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and bone-
marrow transplantation.

A variety of pulmonary function tests may be
ordered. In the early stages of emphysema, the only
result may be dysfunction of the small airways. Patients
with emphysema may show an increase in the total
amount of air that is in the lungs (total lung capacity), but
a decrease in the amount of air that can be breathed out
after taking a deep breath (vital capacity). With severe
emphysema, vital capacity is substantially below normal.
Spirometry, a procedure that measures air flow and lung
volume, helps in the diagnosis of emphysema.
A chest x ray is often ordered to aid in the diagnosis
of emphysema, though patients in the early stages of the
disease may have normal findings. Abnormal findings on
the chest x ray include over-inflation of the lungs and an
abnormally increased chest diameter. The diaphragm may
appear depressed or flattened. In addition, patients with
advanced emphysema may show a smaller or vertical
heart. The physician may observe blisters in the lungs and
bulging of the accessory muscles of the respiratory sys-
tem. Late in the disease, an EKG will show signs of right
ventricular failure in the heart and increased hemoglobin
due to lower levels of oxygen in the patientâ€™s blood.

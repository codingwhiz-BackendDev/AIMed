True elephantiasis is the result of a parasitic infec-
tion caused by three specific kinds of round worms. The
long, threadlike worms block the body’s lymphatic sys-
tem—a network of channels, lymph nodes, and organs
that helps maintain proper fluid levels in the body by
draining lymph from tissues into the bloodstream. This
blockage causes fluids to collect in the tissues, which can
lead to great swelling, called “lymphedema.” Limbs can
swell so enormously that they resemble an elephant’s
foreleg in size, texture, and color. This is the severely dis-
figuring and disabling condition of elephantiasis.
There are a few different causes of elephantiasis, but
the agents responsible for most of the elephantiasis in the
world are filarial worms: white, slender round worms
found in most tropical and subtropical places. They are
transmitted by particular kinds (species) of mosquitoes,
that is, bloodsucking insects. Infection with these worms
is called “lymphatic filariasis” and over a long period of
time can cause elephantiasis.
Lymphatic filariasis is a disease of underdeveloped
regions found in South America, Central Africa, Asia, the
Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. It is a disease that has
been present for centuries, as ancient Persian and Indian
writings clearly described elephant-like swellings of the
arms, legs, and genitals. It is estimated that 120 million
people in the world have lymphatic filariasis, as of 1997.
The disease appears to be spreading, in spite of decades
of research in this area.
Other terms for elephantiasis are Barbados leg, ele-
phant leg, morbus herculeus, mal de Cayenne, and
myelolymphangioma.

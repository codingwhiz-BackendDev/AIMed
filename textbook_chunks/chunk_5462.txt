in contact with an irritating substance. The symptoms
can take many forms: redness, itching, crusting,
swelling, blistering, oozing, dryness, scaliness, thicken-
ing of the skin, and a feeling of warmth at the site of con-
tact. In extreme cases, severe blistering can occur and
open sores can form. Jobs that require frequent skin
exposure to water, such as hairdressing and food prepara-
tion, can make the skin more susceptible to ICD.
Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) results when
repeated exposure to an allergen (an allergy-causing sub-
stance) triggers an immune response that inflames the
skin. Tens of thousands of drugs, pesticides, cosmetics,
food additives, commercial chemicals, and other sub-
stances have been identified as potential allergens. Fewer
than 30, however, are responsible the majority of ACD
cases. Common culprits include poison ivy, poison oak,
and poison sumac; fragrances and preservatives in cosmet-
ics and personal care products; latex items such as gloves
and condoms; and formaldehyde. Many people find that
they are allergic to the nickel in inexpensive jewelry. ACD
is usually confined to the area of skin that comes in contact
with the allergen, typically the hands or face. Symptoms
range from mild to severe and resemble those of ICD; a
patch test may be needed to determine which kind of con-
tact dermatitis a person is suffering from.

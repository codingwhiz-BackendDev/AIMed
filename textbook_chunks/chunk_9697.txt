There is no cure for Edwards’ syndrome. Since tri-
somy 18 babies frequently have major physical abnor-
malities, doctors and parents face difficult choices
regarding treatment. Abnormalities can be treated to a
certain degree with surgery, but extreme invasive proce-
dures may not be in the best interests of an infant whose
lifespan is measured in days or weeks. Medical therapy
often consists of supportive care with the goal of making
the infant comfortable, rather than prolonging life.

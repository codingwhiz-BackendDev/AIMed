intraocular, extraocular and recurrent retinoblastoma. In
the intraocular form the cancer can be found in one or
both eyes but not in tissue external of the eye. In the
extraocular form the cancer has spread outside the eye. It
can spread to the tissue surrounding the eye or it can
invade other areas of the body. In the recurrent form the
cancer returns after already being treated. It may recur in
the eye, its surrounding tissues, or elsewhere in the body.
Intraocular melanoma is a rare cancer overall, yet it
is the most common eye cancer seen in adults. It is when
cancer cells are found in the uvea of the eye. The uvea
includes the iris (the colored portion of eye), the ciliary
body (an eye muscle that focuses the lens) and the
choroid (found in the back of the eye next to the retina).
Intraocular cancer of the iris usually grows slowly
and usually doesnâ€™t spread. The tumor is seen on the iris
as a darker spot than the surrounding area. Intraocular
cancer of the choroid or ciliary body occurs in the back
of the eye. They are classified by size with a small tumor
being 2-3 mm or smaller and a medium or large tumor
being bigger than 3 mm.
Intraocular cancer can spread and become extraocu-
lar as well. If not found and treated early enough it can
spread to the surrounding tissues, the optic nerve or into
the eye socket.

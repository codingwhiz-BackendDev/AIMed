Definition
Carbohydrate intolerance is the inability of the body
to completely process the nutrient carbohydrate (a classi-
fication that includes sugars and starches) into a source of
energy for the body, usually because of the deficiency of
an enzyme needed for digestion. Lactose intolerance, the
inability to digest the sugar found in milk, is widespread
and affects up to 70% of the worldâ€™s adult population.

There is no known cure for fibromyalgia. Therefore,
the goal of treatment is successful symptom manage-
ment. Treatment usually requires a combination of thera-
pies, exercise, proper rest, and diet. A patient’s clear
understanding of his or her role in the recovery process is
imperative for successful management of this condition.
Treatments found to be helpful include heat and occa-
sionally cold applications. A regular stretching program is
often useful. Aerobic activities focusing on increasing the
heart rate are the preferred forms of exercise over most
other forms of exertion. Exercise programs need to include
good warm-up and cool-down sessions, with special atten-
tion given to avoiding exercises causing joint pain. The
diet should include a large variety of fruits and vegetables
which provide the body with trace elements and minerals
that are necessary for healthy muscles.
Adequate rest is essential in the treatment of
fibromyalgia. Avoidance of stimulating foods or drinks
(such as coffee) and medications like decongestants
prior to bedtime is advised. If diet, exercise, and ade-
quate rest do not relieve the symptoms of fibromyalgia,
medications may be prescribed. Medications prescribed
and found to have some benefit include antidepressant
drugs, muscle relaxants, and anti-inflammatory drugs.
People with fibromyalgia often need a rheumatology
consultation (a meeting with a doctor who specializes in
disorders of the joints, muscles, and soft tissue) to decide
the cause of various rheumatic symptoms, to be educated
about fibromyalgia and its treatment, and to exclude other
rheumatic diseases. A treatment program must be individ-
ualized to meet the patient’s needs. The rheumatologist,
as the team leader, enlists and coordinates the expertise of
other health professionals in the care of the patient.

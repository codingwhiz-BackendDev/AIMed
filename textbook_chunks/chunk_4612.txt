Red/green and blue color blindness appear to be
located on at least two different gene locations. The
majority of affected individuals are males. Females are
carriers, but are not normally affected. This indicates that
the X chromosome is one of the locations for color blind-
ness. Male offspring of females who carry the altered
gene have a 50-50 chance of being color-blind. The rare
female that has red/green color blindness, or rarer still,
blue color blindness, indicates there is an involvement of
another gene. As of 2001, the location of this gene has
not been identified.
Achromatopsia, the complete inability to distinguish
color, is an autosomal recessive disease of the retina.
This means that both parents have one copy of the altered
gene but do not have the disease. Each of their children
has a 25% chance of not having the gene, a 50% chance
of having one altered gene (and, like the parents, being
unaffected), and a 25% risk of having both the altered
gene and the condition. In 1997, the achromatopsia gene
was located on chromosome 2.
The inability to correctly identify colors is the only
sign of color blindness. It is important to note that people
with red/green or blue varieties of color blindness use
other cues such as color saturation and object shape or
location to distinguish colors. They can often distinguish

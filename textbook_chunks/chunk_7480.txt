Dehydration in children usually results from losing
large amounts of fluid and not drinking enough water to
replace the loss. This condition generally occurs in chil-
dren who have stomach flu characterized by vomiting
and diarrhea, or who can not or will not take enough
fluids to compensate for excessive losses associated with
fever and sweating of acute illness. An infant can
become dehydrated only hours after becoming ill. Dehy-
dration is a major cause of infant illness and death
throughout the world.

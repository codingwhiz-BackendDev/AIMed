The EP diagnostic study and catheter ablation are low-
risk procedures. There is a small risk of bleeding and/or
infection at the site of catheter insertion, but this occurs less
than 1% of the time. Blood clot formation occurs only two
in 1,000 instances and is minimized with blood thinner
medications administered during the procedure. Vascular
injuries causing hemorrhage or thrombophlebitis are pos-
sible but occur less than 0.7% of the time. Cardiac perfora-
tions occur only in one or two per 1,000 instances. If the
right internal jugular vein is accessed, the small possibility
of puncturing the lung with the catheter exists, which, at
worst, could cause a collapsed lung.
Because ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
(lethal arrhythmias) may be induced in the patient, the
EP lab personnel must be prepared to defibrillate the
patient as necessary.

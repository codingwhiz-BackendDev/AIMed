Laboratory testing for cryoglobulin is based on the
fact that cryoglobulin clumps when cooled and dissolves
when warmed. The test is done on a person’s serum (the
yellow liquid part of blood that separates from the cells
after the blood clots). The serum is kept warm from the
time drawn until the cells and the serum are separated in
the laboratory. The serum is placed at 33.8°F (1°C) for
one to seven days. If there is clumping, cryoglobulins are
present. The amount of cryoglobulins is determined by
measuring the amount of clumping. Negative tests are
checked through seven days.
Additional testing is done to find out what kind of
cryoglobulin protein is present. There are three kinds of
cryoglobulin, each associated with different diseases.
The test, also called the cold sensitivity antibodies
test, is covered by insurance when medically necessary.
Results are usually available the following day.

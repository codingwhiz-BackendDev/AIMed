of chronic fatigue syndrome is signifi-
cantly more difficult. Because there is no specific biolog-
ical marker or conclusive blood test to check for the dis-
order, healthcare providers must rely on the patientâ€™s pre-

In many cases, individuals with chronic fatigue syn-
drome go through a battery of invasive diagnostic tests
and several years of consultation with medical profes-
sionals before receiving a correct diagnosis.

The symptoms of opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis are
similar to those of fascioliasis and include both acute and
chronic forms. In acute infection, the patient may be tired,
have a low-grade fever, pains in the joints, a swollen liver,
abdominal pain, and a skin rash. The acute syndrome may
be difficult to diagnose because the fluke eggs do not appear
in the patientâ€™s stool for three to four weeks after infection.
Patients with the chronic form of the disease experience a
loss of appetite, fatigue, low-grade fever, diarrhea, and an
enlarged liver that feels sore when the abdomen is pressed.

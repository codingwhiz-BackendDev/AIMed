Coagulation begins typically with an injury to some
part of the body. The injury sets in motion a cascade of
biochemical activities (the coagulation cascade) to stop
the bleeding, by forming a clot from a mixture of the
blood protein fibrin and platelets.
Once bleeding is stopped, another blood protein dis-
solves the clot by breaking down the fibrin into frag-
ments. Measurement of these fragments gives informa-
tion about the clot dissolving portion of coagulation,
called fibrinolysis.
In DIC, the coagulation cascade is triggered in an
abnormal way. A blood infection, a transfusion reaction,
a large amount of tissue damage, such as a burn, a dead
fetus, and some cancers can begin the chain of biochemi-
cal events leading to blood clots. The coagulation cas-
cade becomes overwhelmed with excessive clotting fol-
lowed by excessive bleeding. As the large number of
clots dissolve, fibrin split products accumulate in the
blood and encourage even more bleeding.
Laboratory tests for FSP are done on the yellow liq-
uid portion left over after blood clots (serum). A personâ€™s
serum is mixed with a substance that binds to FSP. This
bound complex is measured, and the original amount of
FSP is determined. Some test methods give an actual
measurement of FSP; some give a titer, or dilution.
Methods that provide a titer look for the presence or
absence of FSP. If the serum is positive for FSP, the
serum is diluted, or titered, and the test is done again.
These steps are repeated until the serum is so dilute that
it no longer gives a positive result. The last dilution that
gives a positive result is the titer reported.
The FSP test is covered by insurance when medical-
ly necessary. Results are usually available within one to
two hours. Other names for this test are fibrin degrada-
tion products, fibrin breakdown products, or FDP.

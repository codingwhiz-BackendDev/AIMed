A physician who specializes in the treatment of the
foot (podiatrist) or the doctor who normally treats the
patientâ€™s diabetes will treat the infection. An x ray of the
foot will be taken to determine whether the bone has
become infected. A sample from the wound will be cul-
tured to identify the organism that is causing the infec-
tion so that the appropriate antibiotic can be selected.

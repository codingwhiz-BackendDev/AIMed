The slit lamp is a microscope with a light source that
can be adjusted. This magnifies the external and some
internal structures of the eyes. The lid and lid margin,
cornea, iris, pupil, conjunctiva, sclera, and lens are exam-
ined. The slit lamp is also used in contact lens evalua-
tions. A little probe called a tonometer may be used at
this time to check the pressure of the eyes. A colored eye-
drop may be instilled immediately prior to this test. The
drop has a local anesthetic so the patient wonâ€™t feel the
probe touch the eye. It is a quick procedure.

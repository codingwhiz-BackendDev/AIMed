• Calcium. 8.8–10.4 mg/dL (total Ca; serum); 4.7–5.2
mg/dL (unbound Ca; serum)
• Magnesium. 1.4–2.1 mEq/L (plasma)
• Chloride. 100–108 mEq/L (serum)
• Phosphate. 2.5–4.5 mg/dL (plasma; adults)
Standard ranges for test results may vary due to dif-
fering laboratory standards and physiological variances
(i.e., gender, age, and other factors). Other blood tests
that determine pH levels and acid-base balance may also
be performed.

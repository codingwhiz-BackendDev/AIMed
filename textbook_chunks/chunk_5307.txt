Patent ductus arteriosus refers to the opening of a
passageway—or temporary blood vessel (ductus)—to
carry the blood from the heart to the aorta before birth,
allowing blood to bypass the lungs, which are not yet
functional. The ductus should close spontaneously in the
first few hours or days after birth. When it does not close
in the newborn, some of the blood that should flow
through the aorta then returns to the lungs. Patent ductus
arteriosus is common in premature babies, but rare in
full-term babies. It has also been associated with mothers
who had German measles (rubella) while pregnant.

A cesarean section, also called a c-section, is a surgi-
cal procedure in which incisions are made through a
woman’s abdomen and uterus to deliver her baby.
Cesarean sections are performed whenever abnor-
mal conditions complicate labor and vaginal delivery,
threatening the life or health of the mother or the baby.
The procedure is performed in the United States on near-
ly one of every four babies delivered—more than
900,000 babies each year. The procedure is used in cases
where the mother has had a previous c-section and the
area of the incision has been weakened. Dystocia, or dif-
ficult labor, is the another common reason for perform-
ing a c-section.
Difficult labor is commonly caused by one of the
three following conditions: abnormalities in the mother’s
birth canal; abnormalities in the position of the fetus;
abnormalities in the labor, including weak or infrequent
contractions.
Another major factor is fetal distress, a condition
where the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal brain
damage can result from oxygen deprivation. Fetal dis-
tress is often related to abnormalities in the position of
the fetus, or abnormalities in the birth canal, causing
reduced blood flow through the placenta.
Other conditions also can make c-section advisable,
such as vaginal herpes, hypertension (high blood pres-
sure) and diabetes in the mother.

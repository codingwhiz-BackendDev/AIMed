Heart disorders that cause a decreased, inadequate
amount of oxygen in blood pumped to the body are
called cyanotic defects. Cyanotic defects, including trun-
cus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return,
tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries,
and tricuspid atresia, result in a blue discoloration of the
skin due to low oxygen levels. About 10% of cases of
congenital heart disease in the United States are tetralogy
of Fallot, which includes four defects. The major defects
are a large hole between the ventricles, which allows
oxygen-poor blood to mix with oxygen-rich blood, and
narrowing at or beneath the pulmonary valve. The other
defects are an overly muscular right ventricle and an
aorta that lies over the ventricular hole.
In transposition (reversal of position) of the great
arteries, the pulmonary artery and the aorta are reversed,
causing oxygen-rich blood to re-circulate to the lungs
while oxygen-poor blood goes to the rest of the body. In
tricuspid atresia, the baby lacks a triscupid valve and
blood cannot flow properly from the right atrium to the
right ventricle.

of E. coli gastroenteritis in infants is best
achieved by breast-feeding. The breast milk contains anti-
bodies that combat the infection. For bottle-fed infants,
care should be taken in the preparation of the milk and
bottles. Good hygiene of the umbilical cord area is impor-
tant. Keeping this area clean and dry may reduce infection.

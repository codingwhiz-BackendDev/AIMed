Emergency medical care is always necessary after
successful CPR. Once a personâ€™s breathing and heartbeat
have been restored, the rescuer should make the person
comfortable and stay there until emergency medical per-
sonnel arrive. The rescuer can continue to reassure the
person that help is coming and talk positively until pro-
fessionals arrive and take over.

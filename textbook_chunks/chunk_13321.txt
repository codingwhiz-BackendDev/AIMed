The two most important factors in determining
whether or not a person will develop flesh-eating disease
are: the virulence (ability to cause disease) of the bacteria
and the susceptibility (ability of a person’s immune sys-
tem to respond to infection) of the person who becomes
infected with this bacteria.
In nearly every case of flesh-eating disease, a skin
injury precedes the disease. As bacteria grow beneath the
skin’s surface, they produce toxins. These toxins destroy
superficial fascia, subcutaneous fat, and deep fascia. In
some cases, the overlying dermis and the underlying
muscle are also affected.
Initially, the infected area appears red and swollen
and feels hot. The area is extremely painful, which is a
prominent feature of the disease. Over the course of
hours or days, the skin may become blue-gray, and fluid-
filled blisters may form. As nerves are destroyed the area

Co-management of the patient with cor pulmonale
should be coordinated between the medical doctor and
the alternative practitioner. The first step in treatment is
to determine the cause of the condition and to evaluate
all organ systems of the body. Dietary considerations, for
example, a low-salt diet and reduced fluid intake aimed
at reducing the edema associated with cor pulmonale,
can be supportive aspects of treatment.

The appearance of the skin, paired with pain and
fever raises the possibility of flesh-eating disease. An x
ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed
tomography scans (CT scans) of the area reveals a
feathery pattern in the tissue, caused by accumulating
gas in the dying tissue. Necrosis is evident during
exploratory surgery, during which samples are collected
for bacterial identification.

This test requires 7mL–10 mL of blood. A health-
care worker ties a tourniquet on the patient’s upper arm,
locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts a
needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the blood
through the needle into an attached tube. Collection of
the sample takes only a few minutes.

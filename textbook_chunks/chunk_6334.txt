CJD is diagnosed by a clinical neurological exam
and electroencephalography (EEG), which shows char-
acteristic spikes called triphasic sharp waves. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography
scans (CT) should be done to exclude other forms of
dementia, and in CJD typically shows atrophy or loss of
brain tissue. Lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, may be
done to rule out other causes of dementia (as cell count,
chemical analysis, and other routine tests are normal in
CJD) and to identify elevated levels of marker proteins
known as 14-3-3. Another marker, neuron-specific eno-
lase, may also be increased in CJD. CJD is conclusively
diagnosed after death by brain autopsy. Scientists are
investigating whether testing lymphatic tissue such as the
tonsil may be an early tool in vCJD diagnosis. Addition-
ally, recent studies have suggested that other blood tests
may be useful as well.

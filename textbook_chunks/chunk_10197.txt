The only sure way to diagnose lymphatic filariasis is
by detecting the parasite itself, either the adult worms or
the microfilariae.
Microscopic examination of the person’s blood may
reveal microfilariae. But many times, people who have
been infected for a long time do not have microfilariae in
their bloodstream. The absence of them, therefore, does
not mean necessarily that the person is not infected. In
these cases, examining the urine or hydrocele fluid or
performing other clinical tests is necessary.
Collecting blood from the individual for microscopic
examination should be done during the night when the
microfilariae are more numerous in the bloodstream.
(Interestingly, this is when mosquitoes bite most frequent-
ly.) During the day microfilariae migrate to deeper blood
vessels in the body, especially in the lung. If it is decided
to perform the blood test during the day, the infected indi-
vidual may be given a “provocative” dose of medication
to provoke the microfilariae to enter the bloodstream.
Blood then can be collected an hour later for examination.
Detecting the adult worms can be difficult because
they are deep within the lymphatic system and difficult to
get to. Biopsies usually are not performed because they
usually don’t reveal much information.

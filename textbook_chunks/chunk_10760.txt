Habitual use of enemas as a means to combat consti-
pation can make the problem even more severe when
their use is discontinued. Enemas should be used only as
a last resort for treatment of constipation and with a doc-
torâ€™s recommendation. Enemas should not be adminis-
tered to individuals who have recently had colon or rectal
surgery, a heart attack, or who suffer from an unknown
abdominal condition or an irregular heartbeat.

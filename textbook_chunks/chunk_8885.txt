Most people learn through experience that certain
activities will make them dizzy and they learn to avoid
them. For example, if reading in a car produces motion
sickness, an individual leaves reading materials for after
the trip. Changes to the diet can also cut down on
episodes of dizziness in susceptible people. Relaxation
techniques can help ward off tension and anxiety that
can cause dizziness.
These techniques can help minimize or even prevent
dizziness for people with chronic diseases. For example,
persons with Méniére’s disease may avoid episodes of
vertigo by leaving salt, alcohol, and caffeine out of their
diets. Reducing blood cholesterol can help diminish arte-
riosclerosis and indirectly treat dizziness.
Some cases of dizziness cannot be prevented.
Acoustic neuromas, for example, are not predictable or
preventable. When the underlying cause of dizziness can-
not be discovered, it may be difficult to recommend pre-
ventive measures. Alternative approaches designed to
rebalance the body’s energy flow, such as acupuncture
and constitutional homeopathy, may be helpful in cases
where the cause of dizziness cannot be pinpointed.

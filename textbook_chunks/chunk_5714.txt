Corneal transplant is used when vision is lost in an
eye because the cornea has been damaged by disease or
traumatic injury. Some of the disease conditions that
might require corneal transplant include the bulging out-
ward of the cornea (keratoconus), a malfunction of the
inner layer of the cornea (Fuchsâ€™ dystrophy), and painful
swelling of the cornea (pseudophakic bullous keratopa-
thy). Some of these conditions cause cloudiness of the
cornea; others alter its natural curvature, which can also
reduce the quality of vision.
Injury to the cornea can occur because of chemical
burns, mechanical trauma, or infection by viruses, bacte-
ria, fungi, or protozoa. The herpes virus produces one of
the more common infections leading to corneal transplant.
Surgery would only be used when damage to the
cornea is too severe to be treated with corrective lenses.
Occasionally, corneal transplant is combined with other
types of eye surgery (such as cataract surgery) to solve
multiple eye problems in one procedure.

A colposcopy is performed in a physician’s office
and is similar to a regular gynecologic exam. An instru-
ment called a speculum is used to hold the vagina open,
and the gynecologist looks at the cervix and vagina
through the colposcope instead simply by eye, as in a
routine examination.
The colposcope is placed outside the patient’s body
and never touches the skin. The cervix and vagina are
swabbed with dilute acetic acid (vinegar). The solution
highlights abnormal areas by turning them white (instead
of a normal pink color). Abnormal areas can also be
identified by looking for a characteristic pattern made by
abnormal blood vessels.

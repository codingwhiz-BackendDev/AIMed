oils of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), eucalyptus
blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus), peppermint, (Mentha x
piperata), or scots pine oil (Pinus sylvestris) to stimulate
the nervous system and reduce fatigue. These oils can be
added to bathwater or massage oil as a topical applica-
tion. Citrus oils such as lemon, orange, grapefruit, and
lime have a similar effect, and can be added to a steam
bath or vaporizer for inhalation.

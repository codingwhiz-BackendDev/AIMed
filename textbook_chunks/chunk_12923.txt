The febrile agglutinins test is used to confirm the
diagonsis of certain infectious diseases that stimulate the
body to produce febrile agglutinins. The disease most
commonly diagnosed by this test is brucellosis, a infec-
tion caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Brucella
and characterized by intermittent fever, sweating, chills,
aches, and mental depression. The test is also used to
diagnose certain other infectious diseases: salmonellosis,
caused by Salmonella bacteria and marked by nausea and
severe diarrhea; rickettsial infections, a group of dis-
eases caused by the bacteria Rickettsia; and tularemia,
also called rabbit fever, a bacterial infection character-
ized by a high fever and swollen lymph nodes. The
febrile agglutinins test can also be used to confirm the
presence of two types of cancer, leukemia and lym-
phoma; however, doctors rarely use the test for this pur-
pose, since other diagnostic tests are more reliable.

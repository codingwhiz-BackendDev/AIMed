There are several types of diuretics, also called water
pills:
• Loop diuretics, such as bumetanide (Bumex) and
furosemide (Lasix), get their name from the loop-
shaped part of the kidneys where they have their effect.
• Thiazide diuretics include such commonly used diuret-
ics as hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL, Esidrix),
chlorothiazide (Diuril), and chlorthalidone (Hygroton).
• Potassium-sparing diuretics prevent the loss of potassi-
um, which is a problem with other types of diuretics.
Examples of potassium-sparing diuretics are amiloride
(Midamor) and triamterene (Dyrenium).
In addition, some medicines contain combinations
of two diuretics. The brands Dyazide and Maxzide, for
example, contain the thiazide diuretic hydrochloroth-
iazide with the potassium-sparing diuretic triamterene.
Some nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines
contain diuretics. However, the medicines described
here cannot be bought without a physician’s prescrip-
tion. They are available in tablet, capsule, liquid, and
injectable forms.

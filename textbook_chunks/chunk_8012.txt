of DI include extreme thirst and the pro-
duction of tremendous quantities of urine. Patients with
DI typically drink huge amounts of water, and usually
report a specific craving for cold water. When the amount
of water passed in the urine exceeds the patientâ€™s ability
to drink ample replacement water, the patient may begin
to suffer from symptoms of dehydration. These symp-
toms include weakness, fatigue, fever, low blood pres-
sure, increased heart rate, dizziness, and confusion. If
left untreated, the patient could lapse into unconscious-
ness and die.

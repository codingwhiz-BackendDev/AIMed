The person performing the test locates and marks
specific spots on the patient’s head for placement of elec-
trodes. These spots are cleaned, and an adhesive conduct-
ing paste is applied. Cup electrodes are attached. For
somatosensory EP, spots on the arm or leg are also
marked and cleaned; electrodes may be taped in place.
The patient sits or reclines in a chair throughout the tests.
For a visual EP, the patient focuses on a TV screen
which displays a checkerboard pattern. The eye not being
tested is covered with a patch. For children or others
whose attention may wander, goggles are used which
show the pattern to one eye at a time. Each eye is usually
tested twice, and the entire procedure takes approximate-
ly 30–45 minutes.
For auditory EP, headphones are used to deliver a
series of clicks to one ear at a time. A masking or static
sound is played into the other ear. Each ear is usually
tested twice, and the entire procedure takes approximate-
ly 30–45 minutes.
For somatosensory EP, mild electrical shocks are
delivered to the arm or leg. This may cause some twitch-
ing and tingling. The stimulus lasts for about two min-
utes at a time, and the entire procedure takes approxi-
mately 30 minutes.

Blood pressure changes associated with hemodialy-
sis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems. Peri-
toneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option in
these cases.
Peritoneal dialysis is not recommended for patients
with abdominal adhesions or other abdominal defects,
such as a hernia, that might compromise the efficiency
of the treatment. It is also not recommended for patients
who suffer frequent bouts of diverticulitis, an inflamma-
tion of small pouches in the intestinal tract.

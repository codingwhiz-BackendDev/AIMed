EB can be inherited as the result of a dominant
genetic abnormality (only one parent carries the abnor-
mal gene) or a recessive genetic abnormality (both par-
ents carry the abnormal gene).
EB simplex results from mutations in genes respon-
sible for keratin 5 and 14, which are proteins that give
cells of the epidermis its structure. EB simplex is trans-
mitted in an autosomal dominant fashion.
Dystrophic EB is caused by mutations in genes for
type VII collagen, the protein contained in the fibers
anchoring the epidermis to the deeper layers of the skin.
The genetic mutations for junctional EB are found in the
genes responsible for producing the protein Laminin-5.
Dystrophic EB is an autosomal disorder and will only
result if both parents transmit an abnormal gene during
conception.
EB simplex, the most common form of EB, is the
least serious form of the disease. In most affected indi-
viduals, the blisters are mild and do not scar after they
heal. Some forms of EB simplex affect just the hands and

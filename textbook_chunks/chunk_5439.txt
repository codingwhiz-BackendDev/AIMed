Most Americans consume between 11â€“18 g of fiber
a day. Consumption of 30 grams of fiber and between six
and eight glasses of water each day can generally prevent
constipation.
Thirty-five grams of fiber a day (an amount equal to
five servings of fruits and vegetables, and a large bowl of
high-fiber cereal) can relieve constipation.
Daily use of 500 mg vitamin C and 400 mg magne-
sium can prevent constipation. If symptoms do occur,
each dosage can be increased by 100 mg a day, up to a
maximum of 5,000 mg vitamin C and 1,000 mg magne-
sium. Use of preventive doses should be resumed after
relief occurs, and vitamin C should be decreased to the
pre-diarrhea dosage if the patient develops diarrhea.
Sitting on the toilet for 10 minutes at the same time
every day, preferably after a meal, can induce regular
bowel movements. This may not become effective for a
few months, and it is important to defecate whenever
necessary.
Fiber supplements containing psyllium (Plantago
psyllium) usually become effective within about 48 hours
and can be used every day without causing dependency.
Powdered flaxseed (Linium usitatissimum) works the
same way. Insoluble fiber, like wheat or oat bran, is as
effective as psyllium but may give the patient gas at first.

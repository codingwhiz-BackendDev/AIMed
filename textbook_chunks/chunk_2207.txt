Biopsy—The removal of a small piece of living tis-
sue for examination under a microscope.
PAP test—The short term for Papanicolaou test,
this procedure tests a smear of cellular material
scraped from the cervix and examined under a
microscope to detect abnormal cells.
The patient is given general anesthesia, and the vagina is
held open with an instrument called a speculum. Using a
scalpel or laser the doctor removes a cone-shaped piece
of the cervix containing the area with abnormal cells.
The resulting crater is repaired by stitching flaps of tissue
over the wound. Alternatively, the wound may be left
open, and heat or freezing is used to stop bleeding.
Once the tissue has been removed, it is examined
under a microscope for signs of cancer. If cancer is pre-
sent, other tests will be needed. Surgery will be per-
formed to remove the cervix and uterus (hysterectomy)
and other treatments may be used as well. If the abnor-
mal cells are precancerous, a laser can be used to
destroy them.
Cold knife cone biopsy used to be the preferred
treatment for removing abnormal cells in the cervix.
Now, most cone biopsies are performed using laser
surgery. Cold knife cone biopsy is generally used only
for special situations. For example, if a biopsy did not
remove all the abnormal cells, the cold knife cone proce-
dure allows the physician to remove what’s left.

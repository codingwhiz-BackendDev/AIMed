In many cases, coronary artery disease can be suc-
cessfully treated. Advances in medicine and healthier
lifestyles have caused a substantial decline in death rates
from coronary artery disease since the mid-1980s. New
diagnostic techniques enable doctors to identify and treat
coronary artery disease in its earliest stages. New tech-
nologies and surgical procedures have extended the lives
of many patients who would otherwise have died.
Research on coronary artery disease continues.

Before surgery, the doctor pinpoints the location of
the narrowed artery with an x-ray procedure called
angiography. For surgery to be effective, the degree of
narrowing should be at least 70%, but it should not be
total. Patients undergoing angiography are given a local
anesthetic, but the endarterectomy itself requires the use
of a general anesthesia.

Recognition of catatonia is made on the basis of specif-
ic movement symptoms. These include odd ways of walk-
ing such as walking on tiptoes or ritualistic pacing, and
rarely, hopping and skipping. Repetitive odd movements of
the fingers or hands, as well as imitating the speech or
movements of others also may indicate that catatonia is pre-
sent. There are no laboratory or other tests that can be used
to positively diagnose this condition, but medical and neuro-
logical tests are necessary to rule out underlying lesions or
disorders that may be causing the symptoms observed.

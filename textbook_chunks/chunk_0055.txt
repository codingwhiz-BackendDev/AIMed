In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest
in holistic medicine that emphasizes the connection
between mind and body. Aimed at achieving and main-
taining good health rather than just eliminating disease,
this approach has come to be known as alternative medi-
cine. The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 includes a
number of essays on alternative therapies, ranging from
traditional Chinese medicine to homeopathy and from
meditation to aromatherapy. In addition to full essays on
alternative therapies, the encyclopedia features specific
Alternative treatment sections for diseases and condi-
tions that may be helped by complementary therapies.

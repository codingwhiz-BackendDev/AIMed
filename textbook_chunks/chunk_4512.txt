Chemotherapy is useful for patients who have had
all identifiable tumor removed and are at risk for recur-
rence (adjuvant chemotherapy). Chemotherapy may also
be used when the cancer is stage IV and is beyond the
scope of regional therapy, but this use is rare.
Adjuvant therapy is considered in stage II disease
with deep penetration or in stage III patients. Standard
therapy is treatment with 5-fluorouracil, (5FU) combined
with leucovorin for a period of six to 12 months. 5FU is
an antimetabolite and leukovorin improves the response
rate. (A response is a temporary regression of the cancer
in response to the chemotherapy.) Another agent, lev-
amisole, (which seems to stimulate the immune system),
may be substituted for leucovorin. These protocols
reduce rate of recurrence by about 15% and reduce mor-
tality by about 10%. The regimens do have some toxicity,
but usually are tolerated fairly well.
Similar chemotherapy may be administered for stage
IV disease or if a patient progresses and develops metas-
tases. Results show response rates of about 20%. Unfortu-
nately, these patients eventually succumb to the disease,
and this chemotherapy may not prolong survival or
improve quality of life in Stage IV patients. Clinical trials
have now shown that the results can be improved with the
addition of another agent to this regimen. Irinotecan does
not seem to increase toxicity but it improved response rates
to 39%, added two to three months to disease-free survival,
and prolonged overall survival by a little over two months.

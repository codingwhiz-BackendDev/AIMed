Once the procedure for fracture repair is completed,
the body begins to produce new tissue to bridge the bro-
ken pieces. At first, this tissue (called a callus) is soft and
easily injured. Later, the body deposits bone minerals
until the callus becomes a solid piece of bone. The frac-
ture site is thus strengthened further with extra bone. It
usually takes about six weeks for a broken bone to heal
together. The exact time required for healing depends on
the type of fracture and the extent of damage. Before the
use of x rays, fracture repair was not always accurate,
resulting in crippling deformities. With modern x-ray
technology, the physician can view the extent of the frac-
ture, check the setting following the repair, and be certain
after the procedure that the bones have not moved from
their intended alignment. Childrenâ€™s bones usually heal
relatively rapidly.

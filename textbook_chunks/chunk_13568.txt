ed as a cause of neural tube defects in the developing
fetus. Recent research has shown that adequate amounts
of folic acid can prevent up to half of these birth defects,
if women start taking folic acid supplements shortly
before conception.
A healthy adult needs at least 400 mcg of folic acid
every day. Requirements at least double during pregnan-
cy, and increase by 50% when a woman is breastfeeding.
The average American diet, high in fats, sugar, and white
flour, provides about 200 mcg of folic acid, approximate-
ly the amount needed to maintain tissue stores of the sub-
stance for six to nine months before a deficiency devel-
ops. Most of the folic acid in foods (with the exception of
the folic acid added to enriched flour and breakfast cere-
als) occurs as folate. Folate is only about half as available
for the body to use as is the folic acid in pills and supple-
ments. Folate also is easily destroyed by sunlight, over-
cooking, or the storing of foods at room temperature for
an extended period of time.

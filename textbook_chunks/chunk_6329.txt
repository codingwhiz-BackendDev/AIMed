About one in four people with CJD begin their ill-
ness with weakness, changes in sleep patterns, weight
loss, or loss of appetite or sexual drive. A person with
CJD may first complain of visual disturbances, including
double vision, blurry vision, or partial loss of vision.
Some visual symptoms are secondary to cortical blind-
ness related to death of nerve cells in the occipital lobe of
the brain responsible for vision. This form of visual loss
is unusual in that patients may be unaware that they are
unable to see. These symptoms may appear weeks to
months before the onset of dementia.
The most characteristic symptom of CJD is rapidly
progressing dementia, or loss of mental function.

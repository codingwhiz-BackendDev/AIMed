The primary goal of cholesterol treatment is to lower
LDL to under 160 mg/dL in people without heart disease
and who are at lower risk of developing it. The goal in
people with higher risk factors for heart disease is less than
130 mg/dL. In patients who already have heart disease, the
goal is under 100 mg/dL, according to FDA guidelines.
Also, since low HDL levels increase the risks of heart dis-
ease, the goal of all patients is more than 35 mg/dL.
In both alternative and conventional treatment of
high cholesterol, the first-line treatment options are exer-
cise, diet, weight loss, and stopping smoking. Other
alternative treatments include high doses of niacin, soy
protein, garlic, algae, and the Chinese medicine supple-
ment Cholestin (a red yeast fermented with rice).

There is no substitute for treatment by a dentist or
other medical professional. There are, however, homeo-
pathic remedies and herbs that can be used simultaneous-
ly with dental care and throughout the healing process.
Homeopathic arnica (Arnica montana) should be taken as
soon as possible after the injury to help the body deal with
the trauma. Repeating a dose several times daily for the
duration of healing is also useful. Homeopathic hyper-
icum (Hypericum perforatum) can be taken if nerve pain
is involved, especially with a tooth extraction or root
canal. Homeopathic comfrey (Symphytum officinale) may
be helpful in treating pain due to broken jaw bones, but
should only be used after the bones have been reset. Cal-
endula (Calendula officinalis) and plantain (Plantago
major) can be used as a mouth rinse to enhance tissue
healing. These herbs should not be used with deep lacera-
tions that need to heal from the inside first.

There are several common symptoms of cataracts:
• gradual, painless onset of blurry, filmy, or fuzzy vision
• poor central vision
• frequent changes in eyeglass prescription
• changes in color vision
• increased glare from lights, especially oncoming head-
lights when driving at night
• “second sight” improvement in near vision (no longer
needing reading glasses), but a decrease in distance
vision
• poor vision in sunlight
• presence of a milky whiteness in the pupil as the
cataract progresses.

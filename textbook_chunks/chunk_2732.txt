Percussion is rhythmically striking the chest wall
with cupped hands. It is also called cupping, clapping, or
tapotement. The purpose of percussion is to break up
thick secretions in the lungs so that they can be more eas-
ily removed. Percussion is performed on each lung seg-
ment for one to two minutes at a time.

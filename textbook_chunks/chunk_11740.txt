The most common cause of exophthalmos is
Graves’ disease, overactivity of the thyroid gland. The
contents of the orbits swell due to inflammation, forcing
the eyes forward. The inflammation affects primarily the
muscles. This combination of muscle impairment and
forward displacement reduces eye movement, causing
double vision and crossed eyes (strabismus). The optic
nerves can also be affected, reducing vision, and the
clear membrane (conjunctiva) covering the white part of
the eyes and lining the inside of the eyelids can swell.
Finally, the eyes may protrude so far that the eyelids can-
not close over them, leading to corneal damage.

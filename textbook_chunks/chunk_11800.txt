Patients who are taking muscle relaxants or drugs
that act like or have an effect on the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine (cholinergic or anti-cholinergic drugs)
should tell the doctor since they will change the test
results. The results will also be altered if the patient moves
during the test or if the electrodes are improperly placed.

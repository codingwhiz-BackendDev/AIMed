Major depressive and dysthymic disorders are typi-
cally treated with antidepressants or psychosocial thera-
py. Psychosocial therapy focuses on the personal and
interpersonal issues behind depression, while antidepres-
sant medication is prescribed to provide more immediate
relief for the symptoms of the disorder. When used
together correctly, therapy and antidepressants are a
powerful treatment plan for the depressed patient.

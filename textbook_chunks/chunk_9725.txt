can range from mild to severe. EDS classical
type is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
There are three major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS classical type. These include skin hyperextensibili-
ty, unusually wide scars, and joint hypermobility. At this
time there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of classi-
cal EDS. Both DNA and biochemical studies have been
used to help identify affected individuals. In some cases,
a skin biopsy has been found to be useful in confirming
a diagnosis. Unfortunately, these tests are not sensitive
enough to identify all individuals with classical EDS. If
there are multiple affected individuals in a family, it may
be possible to perform prenatal diagnosis using a DNA
information technique known as a linkage study.

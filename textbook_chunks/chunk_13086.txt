• Mammography. A mammogram is an x-ray examina-
tion of the breasts. The two major types of abnormali-
ties doctors look for are masses and calcifications;
either abnormality may be benign or malignant. The
size, shape, and edges of these masses help doctors
determine whether or not cancer is present. Sometimes,
however, this test may be difficult to interpret, however,
due to dense breast tissue.
• Ultrasonography. If a suspicious lump is detected during
mammography, an ultrasound (the use of high-frequen-
cy sound waves to outline the shape of various organs
and tissues in the body) is useful (although not defini-
tive) in distinguishing benign from cancerous growths.
• Ductography. A ductogram (also called a galactogram)
is a test that is sometimes useful in evaluating nipple
discharge. A very fine tube is threaded into the opening
of the duct onto the nipple. A small amount of dye is
injected, outlining the shape of the duct on an x ray, and
indicates whether or not there is a mass in the duct.
• Biopsy. If a lump cannot be proven benign by mammog-
raphy and ultrasound, a breast biopsy may be considered.
Usually a tissue sample is removed through a needle
(fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or FNAB) to obtain a
sample of the lump. The sample is examined under the
microscope by a pathologist, and a detailed diagnosis
regarding the type of benign lesion or cancer is estab-
lished. In some cases, however, FNAB may not provide a
clear diagnosis, and another type of biopsy (such as a
surgical biopsy, core-needle biopsy, or other stereotactic
biopsy methods—such as the Mammotome or Advanced
Breast Biopsy Instrument) may be required.

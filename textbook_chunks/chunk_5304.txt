Congenital heart disease occurs when the heart or
blood vessels near the heart do not develop properly
before birth. Some infants are born with mild types of
congenital heart disease, but most need surgery in order
to survive. Patients who have had surgery are likely to
experience other cardiac problems later in life.
Most types of congenital heart disease obstruct the
flow of blood in the heart or the nearby vessels, or cause
an abnormal flow of blood through the heart. Rarer types
of congenital heart disease occur when the newborn has
only one ventricle, or when the pulmonary artery and the
aorta come out of the same ventricle, or when one side of
the heart is not completely formed.

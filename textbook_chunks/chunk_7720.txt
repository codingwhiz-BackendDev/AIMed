Soft tissue injuries may require only cold compress-
es to reduce swelling. Bleeding may be controlled with
direct pressure applied with clean gauze. Deep lacera-
tions and punctures may require stitches. Pain may be
managed with aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol,
Aspirin Free Excedrin) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil).

Caffeine makes people more alert, less drowsy, and
improves coordination. Combined with certain pain
relievers or medicines for treating migraine headache,
caffeine makes those drugs work more quickly and effec-
tively. Caffeine alone can also help relieve headaches.
Antihistamines are sometimes combined with caffeine
to counteract the drowsiness that those drugs cause. Caf-
feine is also sometimes used to treat other conditions,
including breathing problems in newborns and in young
babies after surgery.

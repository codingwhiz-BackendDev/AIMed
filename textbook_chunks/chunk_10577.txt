Endometriosis is a condition in which bits of the tis-
sue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grow
in other parts of the body. Like the uterine lining, this tis-
sue builds up and sheds in response to monthly hormonal
cycles. However, there is no natural outlet for the blood
discarded from these implants. Instead, it falls onto sur-
rounding organs, causing swelling and inflammation. This
repeated irritation leads to the development of scar tissue
and adhesions in the area of the endometrial implants.

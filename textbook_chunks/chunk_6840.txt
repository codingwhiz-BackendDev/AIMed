The first aim of treatment as with any severe diar-
rheal illness is to avoid dehydration and malnutrition.
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or intravenous fluids
are sometimes needed. Medications used to treat diarrhea
by decreasing intestinal motility, such as loperamide or
diphenoxylate are also useful, but should only be used
with the advice of a physician.

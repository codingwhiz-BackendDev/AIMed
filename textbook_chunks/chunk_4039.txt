Most orthopedic surgeons agree that the initial treat-
ment of congenital (present at birth) clubfoot should be
non-operative. Non-surgical treatment should begin in
the first days of life to take advantage of the favorable
fibro-elastic properties of the footâ€™s connective tissues,
those forming the ligaments, joint capsules, and tendons.
In a common treatment, a series of casts is applied over a
period of months to reposition the foot into a normal
alignment. In mild cases, splinting and wearing braces at
night may correct the abnormality.
When clubfoot is severe enough to require surgery,
the condition is usually not completely correctable,
although significant improvement is possible. In the most
severe cases, surgery may be required, especially when
the Achilles tendon, which joins the muscles in the calf
to the bone of the heel, needs to be lengthened. Because
an early operation induces fibrosis, a scarring and stiff-
ness of the tissue, surgery should be delayed until an
affected child is at least three months old.
Much of a clubfoot abnormality can be corrected by
the use of manipulation and casting during the first three
months of life. Proper manipulative techniques must be
followed by applications of appropriately molded plaster
casts to provide effective and safe correction of most
varieties of clubfoot. Long-term care by an orthopedist is
required after initial treatment to ensure that the correc-
tion of the abnormality is maintained. Exercises, correc-
tive shoes, or nighttime splints may be needed until the
child stops growing.

Colposcopy is a painless procedure that does not
require any anesthetic medication. If a biopsy is done,
there may be mild cramps or a sharp pinching when the
tissue is removed. To lessen this pain, your doctor may
recommend 800 mg of ibuprofen (Motrin) taken the
night before and the morning of the procedure (no later
than 30 minutes before the appointment). Patients who
are pregnant or allergic to aspirin or ibuprofen can take
two tablets of acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead.

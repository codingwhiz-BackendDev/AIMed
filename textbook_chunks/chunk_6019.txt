the adrenal glands coordinate the production of cortisol.
After corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is made in
the hypothalamus, CRH stimulates the pituitary to pro-
duce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The produc-
tion of ACTH in turn stimulates a part of the adrenal
glands known as the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol.
Rising levels of cortisol act as a negative feedback to cur-
tail further production of CRH and ACTH, thus complet-
ing an elaborate feedback mechanism.

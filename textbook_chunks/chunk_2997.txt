Short-acting narcotics can ease pain and don’t inter-
fere with a woman’s ability to push. However, they can
cause sedation, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Narcotics
cross the placenta and may slow down a baby’s breathing;
they can’t be given too close to the time of delivery.
Natural childbirth and preparation for childbirth
There are several methods to prepare for childbirth.
The one selected often depends on what is available
through the healthcare provider. Overall, family involve-
ment is receiving increased attention by the healthcare
systems, and many hospitals now offer birthing rooms
and maternity centers to help the entire family. There are
several choices available for childbirth preparation.
Lamaze, or Lamaze-Pavlov, is the most common in
the United States today. It was the first popular natural
childbirth method, becoming popular in the 1960s.
Breathing exercises and concentration on a focal point
are practiced to allow mothers to control pain while
maintaining consciousness. This allows the flow of oxy-
gen to the baby and to the muscles in the uterus to be
maintained. A partner coaches the mother throughout the
birthing process.
The Read method, named for Dick Read, is a tech-
nique of breathing that was originated in the 1930s to
help mothers deal with apprehension and tension associ-
ated with childbirth. This natural childbirth method uses
different breathing for the different stages of childbirth.
The LeBoyer method stresses a relaxed delivery in a
quiet, dim room. It attempts to avoid overstimulation of
the baby and to foster mother-child bonding by placing
the baby on the mother’s abdomen and having the mother
massage him or her immediately after the birth. Then the
father washes the baby in a warm bath.
The Bradley method is called father-coached child-
birth, because it focuses on the father serving as coach
throughout the process. It encourages normal activities
during the first stages of labor.

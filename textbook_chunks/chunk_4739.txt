the cerebal cortex or the brainstem, while metabolic
causes of coma consist of those conditions that change
the chemical environment of the brain, thereby adversely
affecting function.
There are many metabolic causes of coma, including:
• A decrease in the delivery to the brain of substances
necessary for appropriate brain functioning, such as
oxygen, glucose (sugar), and sodium.
• The presence of certain substances that disrupt the
functioning of neurons. Drugs or alcohol in toxic quan-
tities can result in neuronal dysfunction, as can sub-
stances normally found in the body, but that, due to
some diseased state, accumulate at toxic levels. Accu-
mulated substances that might cause coma include
ammonia due to liver disease, ketones due to uncon-
trolled diabetes, or carbon dioxide due to a severe asth-
ma attack.
• The changes in chemical levels in the brain due to the
electrical derangements caused by seizures.

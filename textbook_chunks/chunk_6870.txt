Cystectomy is a major surgical operation. The
patient is placed under general anesthesia. An incision is
made across the lower abdomen. The ureters are located,
tied and cut. The ureters connect the kidneys to the blad-
der. Cutting them frees the bladder for removal. The
bladder and associated organs are removed. In men, the
prostate is removed with the bladder. In women, the
uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and part of the vagina are
removed with the bladder. The bladder collects urine
from the kidneys for excretion at a later time. Since the
bladder is removed, a new method must be created to
remove the urine. A small piece of the small intestine is
removed, cleaned, and tied at one end to form a tube. The
other end is used to form a stoma, an opening through the
abdominal wall to the outside. The ureters are then con-
nected to the tube. Urine produced by the kidneys now
flows down the ureters, into the tube, and through the
stoma. The patient wears a bag to collect the urine.

Laboratory tests indicating the presence of one of
the strains of Chlamydia are sophisticated, expensive,
and performed in only a few laboratories across the
country. For this reason, doctors diagnose most cases of
chlamydial pneumonia by performing a physical exami-
nation of the patient, and noting the presence of certain
factors. For instance, if the mother of a baby sick with
pneumonia is positive for a sexually transmitted disease
caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, the diagnosis is obvi-
ous. History of exposure to birds in a patient sick with
pneumonia suggests that Chlamydia psittaci may be the
culprit. A mild pneumonia in an otherwise healthy per-
son is likely to be a community-acquired walking pneu-
monia, such as that caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae.

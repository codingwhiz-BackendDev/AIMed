Bleaching involves having a custom-made bleaching
tray made by the dentist. This tray is worn at home for
several hours each day or night. Teeth slowly become
white over a period of one to six weeks. Bleaching can
also be done in a dentistâ€™s office. A heat- or light-activated
bleaching solution is applied to six to eight teeth per visit.
Bonding involves etching the surface of the tooth so
composite resin can adhere. The dentist then contours the
resin to the right shape, and smooths and polishes the
resin after it is hard and dry.
To prepare for the application of a veneer, a thin layer
of enamel is removed from the tooth (so that the finished
tooth will be flush with surrounding teeth) and an impres-
sion of the tooth is taken from which the veneer will be
created. Before a veneer is applied, the tooth is etched
with an acid solution and an adhesive resin is painted on
the tooth. The veneer is then applied, the resin is hardened
with a bonding light, and the dentist polishes the veneer.

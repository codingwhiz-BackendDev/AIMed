Chemotherapy is usually reserved for women with
stage IV or recurrent disease because this therapy is not a
very effective treatment for endometrial cancer. The
anticancer drugs are given by mouth or intravenously.
Side effects include stomach upset, vomiting, appetite
loss, hair loss, mouth or vaginal sores, fatigue, menstrual
cycle changes, and premature menopause. There is also
an increased chance of infections.

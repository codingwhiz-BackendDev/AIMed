Not all wounds need debridement. Sometimes it is
better to leave a hardened crust of dead tissue, called an
eschar, than to remove it and create an open wound, partic-
ularly if the crust is stable and the wound is not inflamed.
Before performing debridement, the physician will take a
medical history with attention to factors that might com-
plicate healing, such as medications being taken and
smoking. The physician will also note the cause of the
wound and the ways it has been treated. Some ulcers and
other wounds occur in places where blood flow is
impaired, for example, the foot ulcers that can accompany
diabetes mellitus. In such cases, the physician or nurse
may decide not to debride the wound because blood flow
may be insufficient for proper healing.

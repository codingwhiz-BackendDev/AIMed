Since some cluster headaches are triggered by stress,
stress reduction techniques, such as yoga, meditation,
and regular exercise, may be effective. Some cluster
headaches may be an allergic response triggered by food or
environmental substances, therefore identifying and
removing the allergen(s) may be key to resolution of the
problem. Histamine is another suspected trigger of cluster
headaches, and this response may be controlled with vita-
min C and the bioflavonoids quercetin and bromelain
(pineapple enzyme). Supplementation with essential fatty
acids (EFA) will help decrease any inflammatory response.
Physical medicine therapies such as adjustments of
the spine, craniosacral treatment, and massage at the
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can clear blockages, as
can traditional Chinese medical therapies including
acupuncture. Homeopathic treatment can also be bene-
ficial. Nervous system relaxant herbs, used singly or in
combination, can allow the central nervous system to
relax as well as assist in peripheral nerve response. A few
herbs to consider for relaxation are valerian (Valeriana
officinalis), chamomile (Matricaria recutita), rosemary
(Rosemarinus officinalis), and skullcap (Scutellaria
baicalensis).

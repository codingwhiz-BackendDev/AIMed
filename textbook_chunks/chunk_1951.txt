The primary treatment for a ruptured aneurysm
involves stabilizing the victimâ€™s condition, treating the
immediate symptoms, and promptly assessing further
treatment options, especially surgical procedures. The
patient may require mechanical ventilation, oxygen, and
fluids. Medications may be given to prevent major sec-
ondary complications such as seizures, rebleeding, and
vasospasm (narrowing of the affected blood vessel).
Vasospasm decreases blood flow to the brain and causes
the death of nerve cells. A drug such as nimodipine
(Nimotop) may help prevent vasospasm by relaxing the
smooth muscle tissue of the arteries. Even with treat-
ment, however, vasospasm may cause stroke or death.
To prevent further hemorrhage from the aneurysm, it
must be removed from circulation. In general, surgical
procedures should be performed as soon as possible to
prevent rebleeding. The chances that aneurysm will
rebleed are greatest in the first 24 hours, and vasospasm
usually does not occur until 72 hours or more after rup-
ture. If the patient is in poor condition or if there is
vasospasm or other complication, surgical procedures
may be delayed. The preferred surgical method is a clip
ligation in which a clip is placed around the base of the
aneurysm to block it off from circulation. Surgical coat-
ing, wrapping, or trapping of the aneurysm may also be
performed. These procedures do not completely remove
the aneurysm from circulation, however, and there is
some risk that it may rebleed in the future. Newer tech-
niques that look promising include balloon embolization,
a procedure that blocks the aneurysm with an inflatable
membrane introduced by means of a catheter inserted
through the artery.

Patients with emboli require immediate hospitaliza-
tion. They are generally treated with clot-dissolving
and/or clot-preventing drugs. Thrombolytic therapy to
dissolve blood clots is the definitive treatment for a very
severe pulmonary embolism. Streptokinase, urokinase,
and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) are
used. Heparin is the anticoagulant drug of choice for pre-
venting formation of blood clots. Warfarin, an oral anti-
coagulant, is sometimes used concurrently and is usually
continued after the hospitalization.
In the case of an arterial embolism, the affected limb
is placed in a dependent position and kept warm.
Embolectomy is the treatment of choice in the majority
of early cases of arterial emboli in the extremities. In this
procedure, a balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into the
artery to remove thromboembolic matter.
With a pulmonary embolism, oxygen therapy is
often used to maintain normal oxygen concentrations.
For people who canâ€™t take anticoagulants and in some
other cases, surgery may be needed to insert a device that
filters blood returning to the heart and lungs.

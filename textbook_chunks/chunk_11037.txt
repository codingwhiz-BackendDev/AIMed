Since eosinophilia is common to a number of condi-
tions, the physician must rule out asthma and infection
by helminths when diagnosing eosinophilic pneumonia.
A whole blood count will reveal an increased number of
eosinophils in the blood. An x ray of the lungs may show
the presence of infiltrates (the eosinophils and fluid). If
sputum is produced in coughing, eosinophils will be seen
instead of the more normal profile of granulocytes seen
when an infectious agent is present.

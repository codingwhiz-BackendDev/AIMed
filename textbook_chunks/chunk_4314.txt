Before a person gets an implant, specialists at an
implant clinic conduct a careful evaluation, including
extensive hearing tests to determine how well the candi-
date can hear.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict who will
benefit from an implant. In general, the later in life a per-
son becomes deaf, and the shorter the duration of deaf-
ness, the better the person is likely to understand speech
with an implant. Likewise,someone with a healthy hearing
nerve will do better than someone with a damaged nerve.
First, candidates undergo a trial with a powerful hear-
ing aid. If the aid can’t improve hearing enough, a physi-
cian then performs a physical exam and orders a scan of
the inner ear (some patients with a scarred cochlea aren’t
good candidates). A doctor may also order a psychological
exam to better understand the person’s expectations.
Patients need to be highly motivated, and have a realistic
understanding of what an implant can and cannot do.

In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg implants in
a location outside the uterus and tries to develop there. The
word ectopic means “in an abnormal place or position.” The
most common site is the fallopian tube, the tube that nor-
mally carries eggs from the ovary to the uterus. However,
ectopic pregnancy can also occur in the ovary, the abdomen,
and the cervical canal (the opening from the uterus to the
vaginal canal). The phrases tubal pregnancy, ovarian preg-
nancy, cervical pregnancy, and abdominal pregnancy refer
to the specific area of an ectopic pregnancy.

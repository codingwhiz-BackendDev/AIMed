Abnormal test result values in the pressure or any of
the substances found in the cerebrospinal fluid may sug-
gest a number of medical problems including a tumor or
spinal cord obstruction; hemorrhaging or bleeding in the
central nervous system; infection from bacterial, viral, or
fungal microorganisms; or an inflammation of the
nerves. It is important for patients to review the results of
a cerebrospinal fluid analysis with their doctor and to
discuss any treatment plans.

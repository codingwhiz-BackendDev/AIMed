The normal bladder should not begin contractions
during filling and should initially expand without resis-
tance. A feeling of fullness occurs with a volume of
100–200 ml. The adult bladder capacity is 300–500 ml.
The sphincter should relax and open when the patient
wills it, accompanied by detrusor contractions. During
voiding, detrusor contraction should be smooth and lead
to a steady urine stream.

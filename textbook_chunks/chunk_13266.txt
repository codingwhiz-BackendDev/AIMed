Ciguatera is caused by eating fish that have a toxin
called ciguatoxin. Scientists believe this toxin is acquired
by the fish through the food chain, and is originally pro-
duced by small algae microorganisms (dinoflagellates).
The fish most likely contaminated with ciguatoxin are
those that feed close to tropical reefs, including red snap-
per, grouper, and barracuda. Larger fish are more likely
to contain the toxin. Although not as common in the
United States, ciguatera is commonly diagnosed on
many of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.
Illness from ciguatera can occur in just a few min-
utes to about 30 hours after eating. Most cases occur one
to six hours after eating the contaminated fish. Initial
symptoms are abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, or
watery diarrhea. The most characteristic symptoms of
the illness are those involving the nervous system. These
include numbness and tingling around the lips, tongue,
and mouth; itching; dry mouth; metallic taste in the
mouth; and blurry vision. In more prominent cases,
patients may complain of temporary blindness, a slow
pulse, and a feeling that their teeth are loose. Patients
may also have the strange symptom of reversal of hot and
cold sensations on the skin, where cold things feel very
hot or painful to the touch. In very severe cases, there
may be difficulties in breathing or low blood pressure.

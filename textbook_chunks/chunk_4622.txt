There is no treatment or cure for color blindness.
Most color vision deficient persons compensate well for
their abnormality and usually rely on color cues and
details that are not consciously evident to persons with
typical color vision.
Inherited color blindness cannot be prevented. In the
case of some types of acquired color deficiency, if the
cause of the problem is removed, the condition may
improve with time. But for most people with acquired
color blindness, the damage is usually permanent.

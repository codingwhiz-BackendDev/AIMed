Extensive research has been conducted to determine
how cocaine works on the brain and why it is so addictive.
Cocaine has been found to affect an area of the brain
known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which con-
nects with the nucleus accumbens, a major pleasure cen-
ter. Like other commonly abused addictive drugs,
cocaine’s effects are related to the action of the neuro-
transmitter dopamine, which carries information between
neurons. Cocaine interferes with the normal functioning
of neurons by blocking the re-uptake of dopamine, which
builds up in the synapses and is believed to cause the
pleasurable feelings reported by cocaine users.

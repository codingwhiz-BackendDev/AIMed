Fecal incontinence, also called bowel incontinence,
can occur at any age, but is most common among people
over the age of 65, who sometimes have to cope with
urinary incontinence as well. It was reported in 1998
that about 2% of adults experience fecal incontinence at
least once a week whereas for healthy independent adults
over the age of 65 the figure is about 7%. An extensive
American survey, published in 1993, found fecal soiling
in 7.1% of the surveyed population, with gross inconti-
nence in 0.7%. For men and women the incidence of
soiling was the same, but women were almost twice as
likely to suffer from gross incontinence.
The wider public health impact of fecal incontinence
is considerable. In the United States, more than $400
million is spent each year on disposable underwear and
other incontinence aids. Fecal incontinence is the second
most common reason for seeking a nursing home place-
ment. One-third of the institutionalized elderly suffer
from this condition. Incontinence sufferers, however,
often hesitate to ask their doctors for help because they
are embarrassed or ashamed. The 1993 American survey
discovered that only one-sixth of those experiencing soil-
ing had sought medical advice, and only one-half of
those afflicted with gross incontinence.

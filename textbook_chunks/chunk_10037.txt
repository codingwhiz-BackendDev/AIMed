Acid-base balance—A balance of acidity and
alkalinity of fluids in the body that keeps the pH
level of blood around 7.35–7.45.
Aldosteronism—A condition defined by high
serum levels of aldosterone, a hormone secreted
by the adrenal gland that is responsible for
increasing sodium reabsorption in the kidneys.
Addison’s disease—A disease characterized by a
deficiency in adrenocortical hormones due to
destruction of the adrenal gland.
Bulimia nervosa—An eating disorder character-
ized by binging and purging (self-induced vomit-
ing) behaviors.
Milk-alkali syndrome—Elevated blood calcium
levels and alkalosis caused by excessive intake of
milk and alkalis. Usually occurs in the treatment
of peptic ulcer.
Orthostatic hypotension—A drop in blood pres-
sure that causes faintness or dizziness and occurs
when one rises to a standing position. Also known
as postural hypotension.
Osmotic pressure—Pressure that occurs when two
solutions of differing concentrations are separated
by a semipermeable membrane, such as a cellular
wall, and the lower concentration solute is drawn
across the membrane into the higher concentra-
tion solute (osmosis).
Tetany—A disorder of the nervous system charac-
terized by muscle cramps, spasms of the arms and
legs, and numbness of the extremities.
trolyte involved. If the disorder is caused by poor diet or
improper fluid intake, nutritional changes may be pre-
scribed. If medications such as diuretics triggered the
imbalance, discontinuing or adjusting the drug therapy
may effectively treat the condition. Fluid and electrolyte
replacement therapy, either intravenously or by mouth,
can reverse electrolyte depletion.
Hemodialysis treatment may be required to reduce
serum potassium levels in hyperkalemic patients with
impaired kidney function. It may also be recommended
for renal patients suffering from severe hypermagnesemia.

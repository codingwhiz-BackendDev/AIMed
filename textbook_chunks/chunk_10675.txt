Until the 1970s, methods to visualize the bile ducts
produced images that were of relatively poor quality and
often misleading; in addition, the pancreatic duct could
not be examined at all. Patients with symptoms related to
the bile ducts or pancreatic ducts frequently needed
surgery to diagnose and treat their conditions.
Using ERCP, physicians can obtain high-quality x
rays of these structures and identify areas of narrowing
(strictures), cancers, and gallstones. This procedure can
help determine whether bile or pancreatic ducts are
blocked; it also identifies where they are blocked along
with the cause of the blockage. ERCP may then be used
to relieve the blockage. For patients requiring surgery or
additional procedures for treatment, ERCP outlines the
anatomical changes for the surgeon.

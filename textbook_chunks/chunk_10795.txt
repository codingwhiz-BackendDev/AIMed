When drugs have failed to control symptoms of
BPH but the physician does not believe that conventional
surgery is yet needed, a procedure called transurethral
needle ablation may be tried. In the office and using local
anesthesia, a needle is inserted into the prostate and
radiofrequency energy is applied to destroy the tissue
that is obstructing urine flow. Another new approach is
microwave hyperthermia, using a device called the
Prostatron to deliver microwave energy to the prostate
through a catheter. This procedure is done at an outpa-
tient surgery center.

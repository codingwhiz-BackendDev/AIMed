Fatty liver is usually reversible if recognized and
treated. There may be some long-term tendency toward
other types of liver problems depending on how long and
how severe the fatty liver condition was. In pregnant
women with the condition, the situation can be life
threatening for both the mother and the infant. Left
untreated, there is a high risk of death for both the moth-
er and baby. Severe liver damage that may require a liver
transplant can occur in the mother if the condition is not
recognized early.

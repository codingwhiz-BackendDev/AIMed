Some herbal therapies can be useful for skin condi-
tions. Among the herbs most often recommended are:
• Burdock root (Arctium lappa)
• Calendula (Calendula officinalis) ointment
• Chamomile (Matricaria recutita) ointment
• Cleavers (Galium ssp.)
• Evening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis)
• Nettles (Urtica dioica)
Contact dermatitis can be treated botanically and
homeopathically. Grindelia (Grindelia spp.) and sas-
safras (Sassafras albidum) can help when applied topi-
cally. Determining the source of the problem and elimi-
nating it is essential. Oatmeal baths are very helpful in
relieving the itch. Bentonite clay packs or any mud pack
draws the fluid out, and helps dry up the lesions. Corti-
sone creams are not recommended.
Stasis dermatitis should be treated by a trained prac-
titioner. This condition responds well to topical herbal
therapies, however, the cause must also be addressed.

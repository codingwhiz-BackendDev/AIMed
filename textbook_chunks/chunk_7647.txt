Since dementia usually progresses slowly, diagnos-
ing it in its early stages can be difficult. Several office
visits over several months or more may be needed. Diag-
nosis begins with a thorough physical exam and com-
plete medical history, usually including comments from
family members or caregivers. A family history of either
AD or cerebrovascular disease may provide clues to the
cause of symptoms. Simple tests of mental function,
including word recall, object naming, and number-sym-
bol matching, are used to track changes in the personâ€™s
cognitive ability.
Depression is common in the elderly and can be
mistaken for dementia; therefore, ruling out depression is
an important part of the diagnosis. Distinguishing
dementia from the mild normal cognitive decline of
advanced age is also critical. The medical history
includes a complete listing of drugs being taken, since a
number of drugs can cause dementia-like symptoms.
Determining the cause of dementia may require a
variety of medical tests, chosen to match the most likely
etiology. Cerebrovascular disease, hydrocephalus, and
tumors may be diagnosed with x-rays, CT or MRI scans,
and vascular imaging studies. Blood tests may reveal
nutritional deficiencies or hormone imbalances.

The cause of CTCL is unknown. Exposure to chemi-
cals or pesticides has been suggested but the most recent
study on the subject failed to show a connection between
exposure and development of the disease. The ability to
isolate various viruses from cell lines grown from cells of
CTCL patients raises the question of a viral cause, but
studies have been unable to confirm these suspicions.
The symptoms of CTCL are seen primarily in the
skin, with itchy red patches or plaques and, usually over
time, mushroom-shaped skin tumors. Any part of the
skin can be involved and the extent and distribution of
the rash or tumors vary greatly from patient to patient.
The only really universal symptom of the disease is the

to the doctor for treatment. If the disease spreads outside
of the skin, the symptoms include swelling of the lymph

with skin involvement. Spread to the viscera is most

any organ can be shown to be involved at autopsy.

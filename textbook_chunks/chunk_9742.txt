There are numerous types of EDS, all caused by
changes in one of several genes. The manner in which EDS
is inherited depends on the specific gene involved. There
are three patterns of inheritance for EDS: autosomal domi-
nant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked (extremely rare).
Chromosomes are made up of hundreds of small
units known as genes, which contain the genetic material
necessary for an individual to develop and function.
Humans have 46 chromosomes, which are matched into
23 pairs. Because chromosomes are inherited in pairs,
each individual receives two copies of each chromosome
and likewise two copies of each gene.
Changes or mutations in genes can cause genetic
diseases in several different ways, many of which are
represented within the spectrum of EDS. In autosomal
dominant EDS, only one copy of a specific gene must be
changed for a person to have EDS. In autosomal reces-
sive EDS, both copies of a specific gene must be changed
for a person to have EDS. If only one copy of an autoso-
mal recessive EDS gene is changed the person is referred
to as a carrier, meaning they do not have any of the signs
or symptoms of the disease itself, but carry the possibili-

Approximately 4% of babies are in what is called
the “breech” position when labor begins. In breech pre-
sentation, the baby’s head is not the part pressing against
the cervix. Instead the baby’s bottom or legs are posi-
tioned to enter the birth canal instead of the head. An
obstetrician may attempt to turn the baby to a head down
position using a technique called version. This is only
successful approximately half the time.
The risks of vaginal delivery with breech presentation
are much higher than with a head-first presentation and the
mother and attending practitioner will need to weigh the
risks and make a decision on whether to deliver via a
cesarean section or attempt a vaginal birth. The extent of
the risk depends to a great extent on the type of breech pre-
sentation—of which there are three. Frank breech (the
baby’s legs are folded up against its body) is the most com-
mon and the safest for vaginal delivery. The other types are
complete breech (in which the baby’s legs are crossed
under and in front of the body) and footling breech (in
which one leg or both legs are positioned to enter the birth
canal) are not considered safe to attempt vaginal delivery.
Even in complete breech, other factors should be
met before considering a vaginal birth. An ultrasound
examination should be done to be sure the baby does not
have an unusually large head and that the head is tilted
forward (flexed) rather than back (hyperextended). Fetal
monitoring and close observation of the progress of labor
are also important. A slowing of labor or any indication
of difficulty in the body passing through the pelvis
should be an indication that it is safer to consider a
cesarean section.

Cardiomyopathy is an ongoing disease process that
damages the muscle wall of the lower chambers of the
heart. Congestive cardiomyopathy is the most common
form of cardiomyopathy. In congestive cardiomyopathy,
also called dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of the heart
chambers stretch (dilate) to hold a greater volume of
blood than normal. Congestive cardiomyopathy is the
final stage of many heart diseases and the most common
condition resulting in congestive heart failure.

An unborn baby’s heart rate normally ranges from
120–160 beats per minute (bpm). A baby who is receiv-
ing enough oxygen through the placenta will move
around. The monitor strip will show the baby’s heart rate
rising briefly as he/she moves (just as an adult’s heart
rate rises when he/she moves).
The baby’s monitor strip is considered to be reactive
when the baby’s heart rate rises at least 20 bpm above the
baseline heart rate for at least 20 seconds. This must
occur at least twice in a 20-minute period. A reactive
heart rate tracing (also known as a reactive non-stress
test) is considered a sign of the baby’s well being.

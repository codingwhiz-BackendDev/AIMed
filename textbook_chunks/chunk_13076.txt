• Adenosis. This condition refers to the enlargement of
breast lobules, which contain a greater number of glands
than usual. If a group of lobules are found near each
other, the affected area may be large enough to be felt.
• Cysts. These are fluid-filled sacs in the breast and proba-
bly develop as ducts that become clogged with old cells
in the process of normal emptying and filling. Cysts usu-
ally feel soft and round or oval. However a cyst deep
within the breast may feel hard, as it pushes up against
firmer breast tissue. A woman with a cyst may experi-
ence pain, especially if it increases in size before her
menstrual cycle, as is often the case. Women between the
age of 30 and 50 are most likely to develop cysts.
• Epithelial hyperplasia. Also called proliferative breast
disease, this condition refers to an overgrowth of cells
lining either the ducts or the lobules.

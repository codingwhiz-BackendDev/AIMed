The cause of CVS is still a mystery. Similarities to
migraine suggest a common cause, but as yet no firm evi-
dence has surfaced. Patients can usually identify some
factor that precedes an attack. Vomiting can be protracted
and lead to complications such as dehydration, chemi-
cal imbalances, tearing and burning, and bleeding of the
esophagus (swallowing tube). Between attacks, there is
no sign of any illness.

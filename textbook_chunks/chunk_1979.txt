As noted, CP has many causes, making a discussion
of the genetics of CP complicated. A number of heredi-
tary/genetic syndromes have signs and symptoms similar
to CP, but usually also have problems not typical of CP.
Put another way, some hereditary conditions “mimic”
CP. Isolated CP, meaning CP that is not a part of some
other syndrome or disorder, is usually not inherited.
It might be possible to group the causes of CP into
those that are genetic and those that are non-genetic, but
most would fall somewhere in between. Grouping causes
into those that occur during pregnancy (prenatal), those
that happen around the time of birth (perinatal), and those
that occur after birth (postnatal), is preferable. CP related
to premature birth and multiple pregnancies (twins,
triplets, etc., not “many pregnancies”) is somewhat differ-
ent and considered separately.

• Blood clots. Clots can cause pooling of fluid and may
be accompanied by discoloration and pain. In some
instances, clots may cause no pain.
• Weakened veins. Varicose veins, or veins whose walls
or valves are weak, can allow blood to pool in the legs.
This is a common condition.
• Infection and inflammation. Infection in leg tissues can
cause inflammation and increasing blood flow to the
area. Inflammatory diseases, such as gout or arthritis,
can also result in swelling.
• Lymphedema. Blocked lymph channels may be caused
by infection, scar tissue, or hereditary conditions.
Lymph that can’t drain properly results in edema. Lym-
phedema may also occur after cancer treatments, when
the lymph system is impaired by surgery, radiation, or
chemotherapy.
• Tumor. Abnormal masses can compress leg vessels and
lymph channels, affecting the rate of fluid movement.

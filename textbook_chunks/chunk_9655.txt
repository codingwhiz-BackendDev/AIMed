Normally the body maintains a balance of fluid in
tissues by ensuring that the same of amount of water
entering the body also leaves it. The circulatory system
transports fluid within the body via its network of blood
vessels. The fluid, which contains oxygen and nutrients
needed by the cells, moves from the walls of the blood
vessels into the bodyâ€™s tissues. After its nutrients are used
up, fluid moves back into the blood vessels and returns to
the heart. The lymphatic system (a network of channels
in the body that carry lymph, a colorless fluid containing
white blood cells to fight infection) also absorbs and
transports this fluid. In edema, either too much fluid
moves from the blood vessels into the tissues, or not
enough fluid moves from the tissues back into the blood
vessels. This fluid imbalance can cause mild to severe
swelling in one or more parts of the body.

Tuberculosis can be observed on chest x rays, as
can cardiac disease and damage to the ribs or lungs.
Chest x rays are used to see foreign bodies that may
have been swallowed or inhaled, and to evaluate
response to treatment for various diseases. Often the
chest x ray is also used to verify correct placement of
chest tubes or catheters.

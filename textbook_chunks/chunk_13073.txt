of fibrocystic breast condition range
from mildly annoying in some women to extremely
painful in others. The severity of discomfort may vary
from month to month in the same woman. Although
sometimes distressing, this experience is the body’s nor-
mal response to routine hormonal changes.
This cycle of breast sensitivity, pain and/or enlarge-
ment, can also result from medications. Some hormone
replacement therapies (estrogen and progesterone) used
for postmenopausal women can produce these effects.
Other medications, primarily, but not exclusively those
with hormones may also provoke these symptoms.
Breast pain unrelated to hormone shifts is called
“noncyclic” pain. “Trigger-zone breast pain” is a term
that may also be used to describe this area-specific pain.
This type of pain may be continuous, or it may be felt
intermittently. Trauma, such as a blow to the chest area, a
prior breast biopsy, or sensitivity to certain medications
may also underlie this type of pain. Fibrocystic condition
of the breast may be cited as the cause of otherwise unex-
plained breast pain.
Lumps, apart from those clearly associated with hor-
mone cycles, may also be placed under the heading of
fibrocystic condition. These lumps stand out from enlarged
general breast tissue. Although noncancerous lumps may
occur, the obvious concern with such lumps is cancer.

The key to treating cholera lies in preventing dehy-
dration by replacing the fluids and electrolytes lost
through diarrhea and vomiting. The discovery that rehy-
dration can be accomplished orally revolutionized the
treatment of cholera and other, similar diseases by mak-
ing this simple, cost-effective treatment widely available
throughout the world. The World Health Organization
has developed an inexpensive oral replacement fluid con-
taining appropriate amounts of water, sugar, and salts
that is used worldwide. In cases of severe dehydration,
replacement fluids must be given intravenously. Patients
should be encouraged to drink when they can keep liq-
uids down and eat when their appetite returns. Recovery
generally takes three to six days.
Adults may be given the antibiotic tetracycline to
shorten the duration of the illness and reduce fluid loss.
The World Health Organization recommends this antibi-
otic treatment only in cases of severe dehydration. If
antibiotics are overused, the cholera bacteria organism
may become resistant to the drug, making the antibiotic
ineffective in treating even severe cases of cholera. Tetra-
cycline is not given to children whose permanent teeth

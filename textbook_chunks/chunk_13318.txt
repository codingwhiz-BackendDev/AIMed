Although the term is technically incorrect, flesh-eat-
ing disease is an apt descriptor: the infection appears to
devour body tissue. Media reports increased in the mid-
dle and late 1990s, but the disease is not new. Hip-
pocrates described it more than three millennia ago and
thousands of reports exist from the Civil War. Approxi-
mately 500 to 1,500 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur
in the United States each year.
Flesh-eating disease is divided into two types. Type I
is caused by anaerobic bacteria, with or without the pres-
ence of aerobic bacteria. Type II, also called hemolytic
streptococcal gangrene, is caused by group A streptococ-
ci; other bacteria may or may not be present. The disease
may also be called synergistic gangrene.
Type I fasciitis typically affects the trunk, abdomen,
and genital area. For example, Fournier’s gangrene is a
“flesh-eating” disease in which the infection encompass-
es the external genitalia. The arms and legs are most
often affected in type II fasciitis, but the infection may
appear anywhere.

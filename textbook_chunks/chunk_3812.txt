There are several important risk factors for COPD:
• Lifestyle. Cigarette smoking is by far the most important
risk factor for COPD (80% of all cases). Cigar and pipe
smoking can also cause COPD. Air pollution and indus-
trial dusts and fumes are other important risk factors.
• Age. Chronic bronchitis is more common in people
over 40 years old; emphysema occurs more often in
people 65 years of age and older.
• Socioeconomic class. COPD-related deaths are about
twice as high among unskilled and semi-skilled labor-
ers as among professionals.
• Family clustering. It is thought that heredity predispos-
es people in certain families to the development of
COPD when other causes, such as smoking and air pol-
lution, are present.
• Lung infections. Lung infections make all forms of
COPD worse.
In the general population, emphysema usually devel-
ops in older individuals with a long smoking history. How-
ever, there is also a form of emphysema that runs in fami-
lies. People with this type of emphysema have a hereditary
deficiency of a blood component, an enzyme inhibitor
called alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT). This type of emphysema
is sometimes called “early onset emphysema” because it
can appear when a person is as young as 30 or 40 years
old. It is estimated that there are between 75,000 and
150,000 Americans who were born with AAT-deficiency.
Of this group, emphysema afflicts an estimated 20,000-
40,000 people (1–3% of all cases of emphysema). The risk
of developing emphysema for an AAT-deficient individual
who also smokes is much greater than for others.
The first symptoms of chronic bronchitis are cough
and mucus production. These symptoms resemble a chest
cold that lingers on for weeks. Later, shortness of breath
develops. Cough, sputum production, and shortness of
breath may become worse if a person develops a lung
infection. A person with chronic bronchitis may later

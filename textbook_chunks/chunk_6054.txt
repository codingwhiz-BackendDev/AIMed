Bleaching—Technique used to brighten stained
teeth.
Bonding—Rebuilding, reshaping, and covering
tooth defects using tooth-colored materials.
Composite resin—Plastic material matching natur-
al tooth color used to replace missing parts of a
tooth.
During cosmetic reshaping,
some enamel is
removed from the uneven tooth so it more closely match-
es other teeth.
Orthodontics involves applying braces to the teeth,
and wires are threaded through the braces. These wires
are adjusted to gradually move the teeth to the desired
new positions. Over time, crowded or misaligned teeth
are straightened.
Implants are more secure and natural looking than
dentures or bridgework, but are much more expensive.
First an anchor for the implant is attached to the jaw
bone. This surgery can take several hours. About six
months later, after the bone around the anchor has
healed, a post is attached to the anchor, and an artificial
tooth is attached to the post. The whole process may take
about nine months to complete.

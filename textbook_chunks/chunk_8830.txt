under the age of 50. Men are three times as likely as
women to be stricken with diverticulitis.
Diverticulitis is believed to occur when a hardened
piece of stool, undigested food, and bacteria (called a
fecalith) becomes lodged in a diverticulum. This block-
age interferes with the blood supply to the area, and
infection sets in.
An individual with diverticulitis will experience pain
(especially in the lower left side of the abdomen) and fever.
In response to the infection and the irritation of nearby tis-
sues within the abdomen, the abdominal muscles may
begin to spasm. About 25% of all patients with diverticuli-
tis will have some rectal bleeding, although this rarely
becomes severe. Walled-off pockets of infection, called
abscesses, may appear within the wall of the intestine, or
even on the exterior surface of the intestine. When a diver-
ticulum weakens sufficiently, and is filled to bulging with
infected pus, a perforation in the intestinal wall may devel-
op. When the infected contents of the intestine spill out into
the abdomen, the severe infection called peritonitis may
occur. Peritonitis is an infection and inflammation of the
lining of the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum. Other com-
plications of diverticulitis include the formation of abnor-
mal connections between two organs that normally do not
connect (fistulas; for example, the intestine and the blad-
der), and scarring outside of the intestine which squeezes
off a portion of the intestine, obstructing it.

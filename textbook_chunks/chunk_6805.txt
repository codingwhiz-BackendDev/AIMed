Children in the pre-school or early school years are
most susceptible to CVS, although it can appear any-
where from infancy to adulthood. This disorder was
identified a century ago, but its cause is still unknown.
Episodes can be triggered by emotional stress or infec-
tions, can last hours or days, and can return at any time.
Abdominal pain is a frequent feature.

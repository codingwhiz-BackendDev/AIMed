The patient recovers in a surgical intensive care unit
for at least the first two days after the surgery. He or she is
connected to chest and breathing tubes, a mechanical venti-
lator, a heart monitor and other monitoring equipment, and
a urinary catheter. The breathing tube and ventilator are
usually removed within six hours of surgery, but the other
tubes remain in place as long as the patient is in the inten-
sive care unit. Drugs are prescribed to control pain and to
prevent unwanted blood clotting. The patient is closely
monitored. Vital signs and other parameters, such as heart
sounds and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in arterial
blood, are checked frequently. The chest tube is checked to
ensure that it is draining properly. The patient is fed intra-
venously for the first day or two. Daily doses of aspirin are
started within six to 24 hours after the procedure. Chest
physiotherapy is started after the ventilator and breathing
tube are removed. The therapy includes coughing, turning
frequently, and taking deep breaths. Other exercises will be
encouraged to improve the patientâ€™s circulation and prevent
complications due to prolonged bed rest.
If there are no complications, the patient begins to
resume a normal routine around the second day. This
includes eating regular food, sitting up, and walking

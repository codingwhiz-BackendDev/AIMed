another surgical exploration. Those with recurrence in the
same area as the original cancer, or with a single metastat-
ic tumor in the liver or lung, have a chance that surgery
will eliminate the disease. Patients with more widespread
return of the cancer are generally not treatable with
surgery. The CEA test will not separate the two groups.
Patients who are most likely to benefit from non-
standard treatments, such as bone marrow transplants,
may be determined on the basis of CEA values, com-
bined with other test results. CEA levels may be one of
the criteria for determining whether the patient will bene-
fit from more expensive studies, such as CT scan or MRI.

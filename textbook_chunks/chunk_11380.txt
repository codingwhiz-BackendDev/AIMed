Symptoms should begin to improve within a few
days of beginning to take this medicine. If they do not, or
if they get worse, check with the physician who pre-

Erythromycins may cause mild diarrhea, that usual-

could be a sign of a very serious side effect. Anyone who
develops severe diarrhea while taking erythromycin or
related drugs should stop taking the medicine and call a
physician immediately.

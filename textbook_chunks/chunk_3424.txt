Cholestin hit the over-the-counter market in 1997 as
a cholesterol-lowering dietary supplement. It is a
processed form of red yeast fermented with rice, a tradi-
tional herbal remedy used for centuries by the Chinese.
Two studies released in 1998 showed Cholestin lowered
LDL cholesterol by 20â€“30%. It also appeared to raise
HDL and lower triglyceride levels. Although the supple-
ment contains hundreds of compounds, the major active
LDL-lowering ingredient is lovastatin, a chemical also
found in the prescription drug Mevacor. The FDA banned
Cholestin in early 1998 but a federal district court judge
lifted the ban a year later, ruling the product was a dietary
supplement, not a drug. It is not fully understood how the
substance works and patients may want to consult with
their physician before taking Cholestin. No serious side
effects have been reported, but minor side effects, includ-
ing bloating and heartburn, have been reported.

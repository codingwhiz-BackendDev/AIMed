The first year of life is important as a foundation for
growth and physical and intellectual development in the
future. Children with extreme failure to thrive in the first
year may never catch up to their peers even if their physi-
cal growth improves. In about one third of these extreme
cases, mental development remains below normal and
roughly half will continue to have psychosocial and eat-
ing problems throughout life.

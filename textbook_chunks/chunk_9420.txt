The precautions vary, depending on the type ofear
surgery under consideration. For example, stapedecto-
my (removal of parts of the middle ear and insertion of
prosthesis parts) should not be performed on people with
external or middle ear infection or inner ear disease. For
people with complete hearing loss in the other ear, it
should be performed cautiously. Microsurgery for the
removal of a cholesteatoma (a cyst-like mass of cells in
the middle ear) should not be performed on patients who
are extremely ill or have other medical conditions. Tym-
panoplasty (any surgical procedure on the eardrum or
middle ear) should not be performed on patients with
chronic sinus or nasal problems or in some patients with
medical problems such as poorly controlled diabetes and
heart disease. Surgery for congenital microtia and atresia
(abscense of normal bodily openings, such as the outer
ear canal) should not be performed if the middle ear
space is totally or almost totally absent.

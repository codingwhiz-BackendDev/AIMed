Anemia, which literally means no blood, refers to
blood with abnormally low oxygen-carrying capacity.
The hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen. One
of the many causes of anemia is destruction of red blood
cells, a process called hemolysis (hemo means blood and
lysis means disintegration). A simple blood count
detects anemia. Even the test done before a blood dona-
tion can identify anemia. To detect hemolysis requires
other tests. The Coombs’ tests are conducted in order to
determine the cause of anemia.
One characteristic of hemolysis is the autoimmune
response against the body’s red blood cells. Instead of
protecting the body from outside agents, the immune
system attacks parts of its own body with a deluge of
antibodies. Autoimmunity is thought to be the cause of
many collagen-vascular diseases, including rheumatoid
arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It is also
the cause of the autoimmune hemolytic anemias. The
Coombs’ tests detect the antibodies responsible for the
destruction of the red blood cells.

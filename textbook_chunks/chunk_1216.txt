To understand how a cardiac catheterization is able
to diagnose and manage heart disease, the basic work-
ings of the heart muscle must also be understood. Just as
the body relies on a constant supply of blood to aid in its
everyday functions, so does the heart. The heart is made
up of an intricate web of blood vessels (coronary arter-
ies) that ensure an adequate supply of blood rich in oxy-
gen and nutrients. It is easy to see how an abnormality in
any of these arteries can be detrimental to the heart’s
function. These abnormalities cause the heart’s blood
flow to decrease and result in the condition known as
coronary artery disease or coronary insufficiency.
Catheterization is a valuable tool in detecting and
treating abnormalities of the heart. Through the use of
fluoroscopic (x ray) guidance, a catheter, which may
resemble a balloon-tipped tube, is strung through the
veins or arteries into the heart, so the cardiologist can
monitor a body’s various functions at each moment.
Generally a test that lasts two to three hours, a
patient should expect the following prior to and during
the catheterization procedure:
• A mild sedative may be given that will allow the patient
to relax but remain conscious during the test.
• An intravenous needle will be inserted in the arm to
administer medication. Electrodes will be attached to
the chest to enable the painless procedure known as an
electrocardiograph.
• Prior to inserting a catheter into an artery or vein in the
arm or leg, the incision site will be made numb by
injecting a local anesthetic. When the anesthetic is
injected it may feel like a pin-prick followed by a quick
stinging sensation. Pressure may also be experienced as
the catheter travels through the blood vessel.
• After the catheter is guided into the coronary-artery
system, a dye (also called a radiocontrast material) is
injected to aid in the identification of any abnormalities

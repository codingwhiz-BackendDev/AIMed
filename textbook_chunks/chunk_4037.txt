True clubfoot is usually recognizable and obvious
on physical examination. A routine x ray of the foot that
shows the bones to be malformed or misaligned supplies
a confirmed diagnosis of clubfoot. Ultrasonography is
not always useful in diagnosing the presence of clubfoot
prior to the birth of a child.

There is a growing debate in the medical community
over the efficacy and ethical implications of cell therapy.
Much of the ethical debate revolves around the use of
human fetal stem cells in treatment, and the fact that
these cells must be harvested from aborted fetuses.
While some cell therapy procedures have had proven
success in clinical studies, others are still largely
unproven, including cell therapy for cancer treatment.
Until more large, controlled clinical studies are per-
formed on these procedures to either prove or disprove
their efficacy, they will remain fringe treatments.

Proper exercises are the best preventive measure.
Since tightness of thigh muscles is a risk factor, warming
up before athletic activities is recommended, as well as
participating in a variety of sports rather than just one.
Stretching exercises increase flexibility of the quadri-
ceps, hip flexors, and hamstrings. Strengthening exercis-
es such as short arc leg extensions, straight leg raises,
quadriceps isometric exercises, and stationary bicycling
are also recommended.

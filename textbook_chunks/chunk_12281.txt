After a fainting spell, the person should regain nor-
mal color but may continue to feel weak for a short time.
Lying down quietly for a few moments may help.
In most cases, an attack of fainting is not serious. As
soon as the underlying pain or stress passes, the danger
of repeated episodes also is eliminated.

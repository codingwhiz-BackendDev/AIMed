Symptoms almost always disappear after the under-
lying condition is controlled.
Some patients who have cholestasis experience symp-
toms only after infection develops, but chronic bile-duct
obstruction always leads to cirrhosis. It may also cause
osteoporosis (fragile bones) or osteomalacia (soft bones).
Emergency care is not required unless inflammation
of the bile ducts (cholangitis) develops. Cancer should
be considered when an adult suddenly develops cholesta-
sis after the age of 50.

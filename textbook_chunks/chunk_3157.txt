Diagnosing choking due to mechanical obstruction
is straightforward, since the symptoms are obvious even
to an untrained person. In choking due to infection, the
person, usually a child, will have a fever and signs of ill-
ness before labored breathing begins. If choking is due to
an allergic reaction to medication or insect bites, the per-
son’s earlobes and face will swell, giving an external sign
that internal swelling is also occurring.
Choking due to sleep apnea is usually diagnosed on
reports of symptoms by the person’s sleep partner. There
are also alarm devices to detect the occurrence of sleep
apnea. Eventually sleep may be interrupted so frequently
that daytime drowsiness becomes a problem.

Some new ways of performing CPR have been tried.
Active compression-decompression resuscitation, ab-
dominal compression done in between chest compres-
sions, and chest compression using a pneumatic vest
have all been tested but none are currently recommended
for routine use.
The active compression-decompression device was
developed to improve blood flow from the heart, but clini-
cal studies have found no significant difference in survival
between standard and active compression-decompression
CPR. Interposed abdominal counterpulsation, which
requires two or more rescuers, one compressing the chest
and the other compressing the abdomen, was developed to
improve pressure and therefore blood flow. It has been
shown in a small study to improve survival but more data
is needed. A pneumatic vest, which circles the chest of an
unconscious person and compresses it, increases pressure
within the chest during external chest compression. The
vest has been shown to improve survival in a preliminary
study but more data is necessary for a full assessment.

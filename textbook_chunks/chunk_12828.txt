year-old. Daily living skills were at a level of nine years,
and social skills were at the level of a six-year-old.
In 1996, Streissguth and others published further data
regarding the disabilities in children, adolescents and
adults with FAS. Secondary disabilities, that is, those dis-
abilities not present at birth and that might be preventable
with proper diagnosis, treatment, and intervention, were
described. These secondary disabilities include: mental
health problems; disrupted school experiences; trouble
with the law; incarceration for mental health problems,
drug abuse, or a crime; inappropriate sexual behavior;
alcohol and drug abuse; problems with employment;
dependent living; and difficulties parenting their own chil-
dren. In that study, only seven out of 90 adults were living
and working independently and successfully. In addition
to the studies by Streissguth, several other authors in dif-
ferent countries have now reported on long term outcome
of individuals diagnosed with FAS. In general, the neuro-
logic, behavioral and emotional disorders become the
most problematic for the individuals. The physical features
change over time, sometimes making the correct diagnosis
more difficult in older individuals, without old pho-
tographs and other historical data to review. Mental health
problems including attention deficit, depression, panic
attacks, psychosis and suicide threats and attempts, and
overall were present in over 90% of the individuals studied
by Streissguth. A 1996 study in Germany reported more
than 70% of the adolescents they studied had persistent
and severe developmental disabilities and many had psy-
chiatric disorders, the most common of which were emo-
tional disorders, repetitive habits, speech disorders, and
hyperactivity disorders.

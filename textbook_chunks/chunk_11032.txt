Pneumonia with eosinophils occurs as part of a
hypersensitivity reaction. A hypersensitivity reaction
is an over-reaction of the immune system to a particu-
lar stimulus. As part of the hypersensitive reaction,
cells of the immune system are produced in increased
numbers and migrate into areas targeted by the hyper-
sensitivity reaction. In the case of eosinophilic pneu-
monia, the lungs are the target. Generally, eosinophilia
pneumonia is not a reaction to an infection. There is a
correlation between asthma and eosinophilic pneumo-
nia. Eosinophilic pneumonia can also be caused by
drugs and, in some people, by polluted air. The symp-
toms range from mild (coughing, wheezing, and
shortness of breath) to severe and life threatening
(severe shortness of breath and difficulty getting
enough oxygen). The symptoms may resolve sponta-
neously or can persist for long periods of time. In a
few cases, the disease may rapidly produce life-threat-
ening pneumonia.

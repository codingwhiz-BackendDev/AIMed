Fanconi’s syndrome can be caused by a variety of
genetic defects and by certain environmental assaults.
The genetic diseases known to give rise to Fan-
coni’s syndrome are cystinosis (the most common cause
in children), galactosemia, glycogen storage disease,
hereditary fructose intolerance, Lowe syndrome,
Wilson disease, tyrosinemia, medullary cystic disease,
vitamin D dependency, and familial idiopathic Fan-
coni’s syndrome.
Environmental assaults that cause Fanconi’s syn-
drome include exposure to heavy metals (like cadmium,
lead, mercury, platinum, uranium), certain drugs (like
outdated tetracycline and gentamicin), other substances
(like Lysol, paraquat, toluene, the amino acid lysine
taken as a nutritional supplement), and kidney trans-
plantation.

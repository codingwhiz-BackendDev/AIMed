There is no cure for CFS, but many treatments are
available to help relieve the symptoms. Treatments usual-
ly are individualized to each personâ€™s particular symp-
toms and needs. The first treatment most doctors recom-
mend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a balanced
diet. Prioritizing activities, avoiding overexertion, and
resting when needed are key to maintaining existing
energy reserves. A program of moderate exercise helps to
keep patients from losing physical conditioning, but too
much exercise can worsen fatigue and other CFS symp-
toms. Counseling and stress reduction techniques also
may help some people with CFS.
Many medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal
preparations have been used to treat CFS. While many of
these are unproven, others seem to provide some people
with relief. People with CFS should discuss their treatment

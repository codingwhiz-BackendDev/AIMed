As a palliative, saline drops and sprays are very help-
ful in loosening mucus in the obstructed side and prevent-
ing drying in the other side, where all the air blows. Hot
peppers, such as jalapenos, can produce enough tears and
discharge to flush out a stopped-up nose. An even more
effective treatment is called a nasal lavage, often done
using a small pot with a spout. Saline solution is poured
into one nostril and allowed to flow out the other nostril.
Then, the process is repeated in reverse. These therapies
are all useful to take care of symptoms, but do not correct
the problem. Nasospecific, a procedure where a deflated
balloon is inserted in the nostril and inflated to a large
enough degree to adjust the septal deviation, can be an
alternative to surgery. A trained practitioner in the
nasospecific procedure is necessary.

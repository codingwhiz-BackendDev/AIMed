Ayurveda—Ayurveda is a system of wholistic
medicine from India that aims to bring the individ-
ual into harmony with nature. It provides guid-

Bursitis—Inflammation of a bursa, a fluid-filled
cavity or sac. In the body, bursae are located at
places where friction might otherwise develop.
It is important to see a doctor if the skin of a corn or
callus is cut, because it may become infected. If a corn
discharges pus or clear fluid, it is infected. A family
physician, podiatrist, or orthopedist may:
• remove (debride) affected layers of skin
• prescribe oral antibiotics to eliminate infection
• drain pus from infected corns
• inject cortisone into the affected area to decrease pain
or inflammation
• perform surgery to correct toe deformities or remove
bits of bone

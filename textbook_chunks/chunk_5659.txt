An electrocardiograph (EKG) will show signs such
as frequent premature contractions in the atria or ventri-
cles. Chest x rays may show enlargement of the right
descending pulmonary artery. This sign, along with an
enlarged main pulmonary artery, indicates pulmonary
artery hypertension in patients with COPD. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is often the preferred method
of diagnosis for cor pulmonale because it can clearly
show and measure volume of the pulmonary arteries.
Other tests used to support a diagnosis of cor pulmonale
may include arterial blood gas analysis, pulmonary
function tests, and hematocrit.

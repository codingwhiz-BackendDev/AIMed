The prognosis in Down syndrome is quite variable,
depending on the types of complications (heart defects,
susceptibility to infections, development of leukemia) of
each individual baby. The severity of the retardation can
also vary significantly. Without the presence of heart
defects, about 90% of children with Down syndrome live
into their teens. People with Down syndrome appear to
go through the normal physical changes of aging more
rapidly, however. The average age of death for an indi-
vidual with Down syndrome is about 50â€“55 years.
Still, the prognosis for a baby born with Down syn-
drome is better than ever before. Because of modern
medical treatments, including antibiotics to treat infec-
tions and surgery to treat heart defects and duodenal atre-
sia, life expectancy has greatly increased. Community
and family support allows people with Down syndrome
to have rich, meaningful relationships. Because of educa-
tional programs, some people with Down syndrome are
able to hold jobs.
Men with Down syndrome appear to be uniformly
sterile (meaning that they are unable to have offspring).
Women with Down syndrome, however, are fully capa-
ble of having babies. About 50% of these babies, howev-
er, will also be born with Down syndrome.

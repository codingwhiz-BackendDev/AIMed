The patientâ€™s symptoms and medical history usual-
ly suggest dehydration. Physical examination may
reveal shock, rapid heart rate, and/or low blood pres-
sure. Laboratory tests, including blood tests (to check
electrolyte levels) and urine tests (e.g., urine specific
gravity and creatinine), are used to evaluate the severi-
ty of the problem. Other laboratory tests may be
ordered to determine the underlying condition (such as
diabetes or an adrenal gland disorder) causing the
dehydration.

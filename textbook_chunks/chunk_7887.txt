Cervix—The opening at the bottom of the uterus.
Colposcopy—A special examination of the cervix
using a magnifying scope. This is a procedure that
can be done in the doctor’s office.
Fallopian tubes—The tubes that carry the ovum
(egg) from the ovary to the uterus.
Pap smear—A screening test for precancerous and
cancerous cells on the cervix. This simple test is
done during a routine pelvic exam and involves
scraping cells from the cervix.
• Fallopian tubes. Some DES daughters have fallopian
tube abnormalities that lead to infertility.
• Uterus. Many DES daughters have a uterus that is
abnormal in size and shape. The classic sign is the T-
shaped uterus. In the normal uterus, the cavity (hollow
space inside) is rounded. In a T-shaped uterus, the cavi-
ty is reduced to a thin T. The abnormal shape of the
inside of the uterus makes it harder for a woman to get
pregnant and leads to a higher risk of premature labor
and birth.

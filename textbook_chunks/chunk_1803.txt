In general, the CNS is well defended against infec-
tion. The spine and brain are sheathed in tough, protec-
tive membranes. The outermost membrane, the dura
mater, and the next layer, the arachnoid, entirely encase
the brain and spinal cord. However, these defenses are
not absolute. In rare cases, bacteria gain access to areas
within the CNS.

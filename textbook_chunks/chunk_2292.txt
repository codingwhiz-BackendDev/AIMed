traction may also be suggested, either at home with the
advice of a physical therapist or in a health-care setting.
Pain is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammato-
ry drugs, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. If these drugs are
ineffective, a short-term prescription for corticosteroids
or muscle relaxants may be given. For chronic pain, tri-
cyclic antidepressants can be prescribed. Although these
drugs were developed to treat depression, they are also
effective in treating pain. Once any pain is resolved,
exercises to strengthen neck muscle and preserve flexi-
bility are prescribed.
If the pain is severe, a short treatment of epidural
corticosteroids may be prescribed with discretion. A cor-
ticosteroid such as prednisone can be combined with an
anaesthetic and injected with a long needle into the space
between the damaged disk and the covering of the nerve
and spinal cord. Injection into the cervical epidural space
relieves severe pain that is not managed with convention-
al treatment. Frequent use of this treatment is not med-
ically recommended and is used only if the more conser-
vative therapy is not effective.
If pain is continuous and does not respond to conser-
vative treatment, surgery may be suggested. Surgery is
usually not recommended for neck pain, but it may be
necessary to address radiculopathy and myelopathy.
Surgery is particularly recommended for people who
have already developed moderate to severe symptoms of
myelopathy, although age or poor health may prohibit
that recommendation. The specific details of the surgery
depend on the structures involved, but the overall goal is
to relieve pressure on the nerve root, spinal cord, or
blood vessels and to stabilize the spine.

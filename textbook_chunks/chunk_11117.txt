When air is inhaled (inspired), it passes through the
nose and the nasopharynx or through the mouth and the
oropharynx. These are both connected to the larynx, a
tube made of cartilage. The air continues down the larynx
to the trachea. The trachea then splits into two branches,
the left and right bronchi (bronchial tubes). These bronchi
branch into smaller air tubes that run within the lungs,
leading to the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli).
Either food, liquid, or air may be taken in through
the mouth. While air goes into the larynx and the respira-
tory system, food and liquid are directed into the tube
leading to the stomach, the esophagus. Because food or
liquid in the bronchial tubes or lungs could cause a
blockage or lead to an infection, the airway is protected.
The epiglottis is a leaf-like piece of cartilage extending
upwards from the larynx. The epiglottis can close down
over the larynx when someone is eating or drinking, pre-
venting these food and liquids from entering the airway.
Epiglottitis is an infection and inflammation of the
epiglottis. Because the epiglottis may swell considerably,
there is a danger that the airway will be blocked off by
the very structure designed to protect it. Air is then
unable to reach the lungs. Without intervention, epiglotti-
tis has the potential to be fatal.
Epiglottitis is primarily a disease of two to seven-
year-old children, although older children and adults can
also contract it. Boys are twice as likely as girls to devel-
op this infection. Because epiglottitis involves swelling
and infection of tissues, which are all located at or above
the level of the epiglottis, it is sometimes referred to as
supraglottitis (supra, meaning above). About 25% of all
children with this infection also have pneumonia.

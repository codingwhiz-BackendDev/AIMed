Chronic kidney failure, also known as chronic renal
failure, affects over 250,000 Americans annually. It is
caused by a number of diseases and inherited disorders,
but the progression of chronic kidney failure is always the
same. The kidneys, which serve as the bodyâ€™s natural fil-
tration system, gradually lose their ability to remove flu-
ids and waste products (urea) from the bloodstream. They
also fail to regulate certain chemicals in the bloodstream,
and deposit protein into the urine. Chronic kidney failure
is irreversible, and will eventually lead to total kidney
failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
Without proper treatment intervention to remove wastes
and fluids from the bloodstream, ESRD is fatal.

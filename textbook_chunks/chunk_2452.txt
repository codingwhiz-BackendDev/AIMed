Activated charcoal is a fine, black, odorless, and
tasteless powder. It is made from wood or other materials
that have been exposed to very high temperatures in an
airless environment. It is then treated, or activated, to
increase its ability to adsorb by reheating with oxidizing
gas or other chemicals to break it into a very fine powder.
Activated charcoal is pure carbon specially processed to
make it highly adsorbent of particles and gases in the
bodyâ€™s digestive system.
Activated charcoal has often been used since ancient
times to cure a variety of ailments including poisoning.

rediscovered as a wonderful oral agent to treat most over-
doses and toxins.

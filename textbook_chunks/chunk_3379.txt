High cholesterol is often diagnosed and treated by
general practitioners or family practice physicians. In
some cases, the condition is treated by an endocrinolo-
gist or cardiologist. Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and
triglyceride levels as well as the cholesterol to HDL ratio
are measured by a blood test called a lipid panel. The
cost of a lipid panel is generally $40–100 and is covered
by most health insurance and HMO plans, including
Medicare, providing there is an appropriate reason for
the test. Home cholesterol testing kits are available over
the counter but test only for total cholesterol. The results
should only be used as a guide and if the total cholesterol
level is high or low, a lipid panel should be performed by
a physician. In most adults the recommended levels,
measured by milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood,
are: total cholesterol, less than 200; LDL, less than 130;
HDL, more than 35; triglycerides, 30–200; and choles-
terol to HDL ratio, four to one. However, the recom-
mended cholesterol levels may vary, depending on other
risk factors such as hypertension, a family history of
heart disease, diabetes, age, alcoholism, and smoking.
Doctors have always been puzzled by why some
people develop heart disease while others with identical

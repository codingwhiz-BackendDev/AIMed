Dr. Jerome Lejeune first described cri du chat syn-
drome in 1963. The syndrome is named for the cat-like
cry made by infants with this genetic disorder. Cri du
chat means “cry of the cat” in French. This unusual cry is
caused by abnormal development of the larynx (organ in
the throat responsible for voice production). Cri du chat
syndrome is also called “5p minus syndrome” because it
is caused by a deletion, or removal, of genetic material
from chromosome 5. The deletion that causes cri du chat
syndrome occurs on the short or “p” arm of chromosome
5. This deleted genetic material is vital for normal devel-
opment. Absence of this material results in the features
associated with cri du chat syndrome.
A high-pitched mewing cry during infancy is a classic
feature of cri du chat. Infants with cri du chat also typically
have low birth weight, slow growth, a small head (micro-
cephaly) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Infants with cri
du chat may have congenital heart defects. Individuals with
cri du chat syndrome have language difficulties, delayed
motor skill development, and mental retardation. Behav-
ioral problems may also develop as the child matures.
It has been estimated that cri du chat syndrome
occurs in one of every 50,000 live births. According to
the 5p minus Society, approximately 50–60 children are
born with cri du chat syndrome in the United States each
year. It can occur in all races and in both sexes.

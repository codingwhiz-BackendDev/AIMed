The best way to prevent cholesterol problems is
through a combination of healthy lifestyle activities, a
primarily low-fat and high-fiber diet, regular aerobic
exercise, not smoking, and maintaining an optimal
weight. But for people with high risk factors for heart
disease, such as a family history of heart disease, dia-
betes, and being over the age of 45, these measures
may not be enough to prevent the onset of high choles-
terol. There are studies being done on the effective-
ness of some existing anti-cholesterol drugs for con-
trolling cholesterol levels in patients who do not meet
the criteria for high cholesterol but no definitive
results are available.

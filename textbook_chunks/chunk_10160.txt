cle) vein. The catheters are about 0.08 in (2 mm) in
diameter, about the size of a spaghetti noodle. The
catheters used in catheter ablation are slightly larger.
With the help of fluoroscopy (x rays on a television
screen), all the catheters are guided to several specific
locations in the heart. Typically, four to 10 electrodes are
located on the end of the catheters, which have the ability
to send electrical signals to stimulate the heart (called
pacing) and to receive electrical signals from the heart—
but not at the same time (just as a walkie-talkie cannot
send and receive messages at the same time).
First, the electrodes are positioned to receive signals
from inside the heart chambers. This allows the doctor to
measure how fast the electrical impulses travel currently
in the patient’s heart. These measurements are called the
patient’s baseline measurements. Next, the electrodes are
positioned to pace: The EP team actually tries to induce
(sometimes in combination with various heart drugs) the
arrhythmia that the patient has previously experienced so
the team can observe it in a controlled environment,
compare it to the patient’s clinical or spontaneous
arrhythmia, and decide how to treat it.
Once the arrhythmia is induced and the team deter-
mines it can be treated with catheter ablation, cardiac
mapping is performed to locate precisely the origin and
route of the abnormal pathway. When this is accom-
plished, the ablating electrode catheter is positioned
directly against the abnormal pathway, and high radio-
frequency energy is delivered through the electrode to
destroy (burn) the tissue in this area.

intracapsular
and extracapsular. Intracapsular surgery is the removal of
both the lens and the thin capsule that surround them.
This type of surgery was common before 1980, but has
since been displaced by extracapsular surgery. Removal
of the capsule requires a large incision and doesn’t allow
comfortable intraocular lens implantation. Thus, people
who undergo intracapsular cataract surgery have long
recovery periods and have to wear very thick glasses.
Extracapsular cataract surgery is the removal of
the lens where the capsule is left in place. Each year in
the United States, over a million cataracts are removed
this way.
There are two methods for extracapsular cataract
surgery. The usual technique is phacoemulsification. A
tiny incision (about 0.12 in or 3 mm long) is made next
to the cornea (the eye’s outer covering), and an ultrasonic
probe is used to break the cataract into minute pieces,
which are then removed by suction. When the lens is too
hard to be emulsified ultrasonically, the surgeon will use
a different extracapsular technique requiring a larger
incision. An incision about 0.37 in (9 mm) long is made,
and the whole lens (without its capsule) is removed
through the incision. Both kinds of extracapsular extrac-
tion leave the back of the capsule intact, so a silicone or
plastic intraocular lens can be stably implanted in about
the same location as the original lens.
The surgery takes about 30–60 minutes per eye.

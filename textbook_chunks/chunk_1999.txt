sidering CP as the answer. CP is nonprogressive, so con-
tinued loss of previously acquired milestones indicates
that CP is not the cause of the problem.
No one test is diagnostic for CP, but certain factors
increase suspicion. The Apgar score measures a babyâ€™s
condition immediately after birth. Babies that have low
Apgar scores are at increased risk for CP. Presence of
abnormal muscle tone or movements may indicate CP, as
may the persistence of infantile reflexes. Imaging of the
brain using ultrasound, x rays, MRI, and/or CT scans may
reveal a structural anomaly. Some brain lesions associated
with CP include scarring, cysts, expansion of the cerebral
ventricles (hydrocephalus), periventricular leukomalacia
(an abnormality of the area surrounding the ventricles),
areas of dead tissue (necrosis), and evidence of an intra-
cerebral hemorrhage or blood clot. Blood and urine bio-
chemical tests, as well as genetic tests, may be used to rule
out other possible causes, including muscle and peripheral
nerve diseases, mitochondrial and metabolic diseases, and
other inherited disorders. Evaluations by a pediatric devel-
opmental specialist and a geneticist may be of benefit.

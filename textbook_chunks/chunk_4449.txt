Medications do not cure colic. Doctors sometimes
recommend simethicone (Mylicon Drops) to relieve gas
pain, but generally advise parents to take a practical
approach to the problem.
Gently massaging the baby’s back can release a
trapped gas bubble, and holding the baby in a sitting
position can help prevent air from being swallowed dur-
ing feedings. Bottle-fed babies can swallow air if nipple
holes are either too large or too small.
Nipple-hole size can be checked by filling a bottle
with cold formula, turning it upside down, and counting
the number of drops released when it is shaken or
squeezed. A nipple hole that is the right size will release
about one drop of formula every second.
Babies should not be fed every time they cry, but
feeding and burping a baby more often may alleviate
symptoms of colic. A bottle-fed baby should be burped
after every ounce, and a baby who is breastfeeding
should be burped every five minutes.
When cow’s milk is the source of the symptoms,
bottle-fed babies should be switched to a soy milk
hydrolyzed protein formula. A woman whose baby is
breastfeeding should eliminate dairy products from her
diet for seven days, then gradually reintroduce them
unless the baby’s symptoms reappear.
Since intolerance to foods other than cow’s milk may
also lead to symptoms of colic, breastfeeding women may
also relieve their babies’colic by eliminating from their diet:
• coffee
• tea
• cocoa
• citrus
• peanuts
• wheat
• broccoli and other vegetables belonging to the cabbage

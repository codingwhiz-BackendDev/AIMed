Periodic touch-up may be needed to keep the teeth
white if the teeth have been bleached or bonded. Also, the
resin used in bonded teeth can be chipped by ice, popcorn
kernels, or hard candy, requiring repair. Veneered teeth
may need to be reveneered after five to 12 years. Once
orthodontic braces are removed, regular visits to the
orthodontist are advised because teeth can shift position.
Implanted teeth require regular dental checkups to ensure
that the anchor and post are stable.

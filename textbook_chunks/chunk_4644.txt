Surgery will result in one of three types of colos-
tomies:
• End colostomy. The functioning end of the intestine
(the section of bowel that remains connected to the
upper gastrointestinal tract) is brought out onto the sur-
face of the abdomen, forming the stoma by cuffing the
intestine back on itself and suturing the end to the skin.
A stoma is an artificial opening created to the surface of
the body. The surface of the stoma is actually the lining
of the intestine, usually appearing moist and pink. The
distal portion of bowel (now connected only to the rec-
tum) may be removed, or sutured closed and left in the
abdomen. An end colostomy is usually a permanent
ostomy, resulting from trauma, cancer or another patho-
logical condition.
• Double–barrel colostomy. This colsotomy involves the
creation of two separate stomas on the abdominal wall.
The proximal (nearest) stoma is the functional end that
is connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract and will
drain stool. The distal stoma, connected to the rectum
and also called a mucous fistula, drains small amounts
of mucus material. This is most often a temporary
colostomy performed to rest an area of bowel, and to be
later closed.
• Loop colostomy. This colostomy is created by bringing
a loop of bowel through an incision in the abdominal
wall. The loop is held in place outside the abdomen by
a plastic rod slipped beneath it. An incision is made in
the bowel to allow the passage of stool through the loop
colostomy. The supporting rod is removed approxi-
mately 7-10 days after surgery, when healing has
occurred that will prevent the loop of bowel from

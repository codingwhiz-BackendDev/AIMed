Radiation therapy is used as an adjunct to surgery
if there is concern about potential for local recurrence
post-operatively and the area of concern will tolerate the
radiation. For instance, if the tumor invaded muscle of
the abdominal wall but was not completely removed, this
area would be considered for radiation. Radiation has
significant dose limits when residual bowel is exposed to
it because the small and large intestine do not tolerate
radiation well.
Radiation is also used in the treatment of patients
who present with or progress to having metastatic dis-
ease. It is particularly useful in shrinking metastatic
colon cancer to the brain.

Dissociative fugue is a disorder in which a person
temporarily loses his or her sense of personal identity and
travels to another location where he or she may assume a
new identity. Again, this condition usually follows a
major stressor or trauma. Apart from inability to recall
their past or personal information, patients with dissocia-
tive fugue do not behave strangely or appear disturbed to
others. Cases of dissociative fugue are more common in
wartime or in communities disrupted by a natural disaster.

Complications following newborn circumcision
appear in one out of every 500 procedures. Most compli-
cations are minor. Bleeding occurs in half of the compli-
cations and is usually easy to control. Infections are rare
and present with fever and signs of inflammation.
There may be injuries to the penis itself, and these
may be difficult to repair. In 2000, there were reports that
the surgical clamps used in circumcision were at fault in
over 100 injuries reported between July 1996 and January
2000. In nearly all cases, the clamps were assumed to be
in working order but had been repaired with replacement
parts that were not of the manufacturerâ€™s specifications.
Physicians were urged to inspect the clamps before use
and ensure that their dimensions fit their infant patients.

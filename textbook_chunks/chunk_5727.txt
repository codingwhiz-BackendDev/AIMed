Corneal transplant is often performed on an outpa-
tient basis, although some patients need brief hospitaliza-
tion after surgery. The patient will wear an eye patch at
least overnight. An eye shield or glasses must be worn to
protect the eye until the surgical wound has healed. Eye
drops will be prescribed for the patient to use for several
weeks after surgery. These drops include antibiotics to
prevent infection as well as corticosteroids to reduce
inflammation and prevent graft rejection.

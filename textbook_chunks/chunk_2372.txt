die from serious infections, hemorrhaging, or other com-
plications. These deaths may be related to the health con-
ditions that made the operation necessary, and not simply
to the operation itself.
Undergoing a c-section may also inflict psychologi-
cal distress on the mother, beyond hormonal mood
swings and postpartum depression (“baby blues”). The
woman may feel disappointment and a sense of failure
for not experiencing a vaginal delivery. She may feel iso-
lated if the father or birthing coach is not with her in the
operating room, or if she is treated by an unfamiliar doc-
tor rather than by her own doctor or midwife. She may
feel helpless from a loss of control over labor and deliv-
ery with no opportunity to actively participate. To over-
come these feelings, the woman must understand why
the c-section was necessary. She must accept that she
couldn’t control the unforeseen events that made the c-
section the optimum means of delivery, and recognize
that preserving the health and safety of both her and her
child was more important than her delivering vaginally.
Women who undergo a c-section should be encouraged
to share their feelings with others. Hospitals can often
recommend support groups for such mothers. Women
should also be encouraged to seek professional help if
negative emotions persist.

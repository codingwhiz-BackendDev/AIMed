CAH is diagnosed by a careful examination of the
genitals and blood and urine tests that measure the hor-
mones produced by the adrenal gland. A number of
states in the United States perform a hormonal test (a
heel prick blood test) for CAH and other inherited dis-
eases within a few days of birth. In questionable cases,
genetic testing can provide a definitive diagnosis. For
some forms of CAH, prenatal diagnosis is possible
through chronic villus sampling in the first trimester and
by measuring certain hormones in the amniotic fluid
during the second trimester.

A febrile agglutinins test can be performed at a doc-
torâ€™s office or a hospital. A nurse or technician will col-
lect a few drops of blood (about 7ml) in a small tube that
has been cooled slightly. The specimen is then taken to a
laboratory where it heated and examined for clumping. If
the cells clump after warming and unclump as they cool,
a febrile agglutinin titer (concentration) of greater than
1:80 is present.

The presence of antibodies means the person has
been infected with CMV, either now or in the past. An
antibody titer at least four times higher at the end of the
illness than at the beginning, or the presence of IgM anti-
bodies, indicates a recent or current first time infection.
People with weak immune systems may not gener-
ate antibodies against CMV. A current infection in a
transplant patient or a person with HIV is confirmed with
other tests, such as viral culture.

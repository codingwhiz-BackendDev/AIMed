Cognitive-behavioral therapy may not be suitable for
some patients. Those who donâ€™t have a specific behav-
ioral issue they wish to address and whose goals for ther-
apy are to gain insight into the past may be better served
by psychodynamic therapy. Patients must also be willing
to take a very active role in the treatment process.
Cognitive-behavioral intervention may be inappro-
priate for some severely psychotic patients and for cogni-
tively impaired patients (for example, patients with
organic brain disease or a traumatic brain injury),
depending on their level of functioning.

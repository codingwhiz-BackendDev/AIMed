Anti-motiltiy medications—Medications such as
loperamide (Imodium), diphenoxylate (Lomotil),
or medications containing codeine or narcotics
that decrease the ability of the intestine to con-
tract. These can worsen the condition of a patient
with dysentery or colitis.
Colitis—Inflammation of the colon.
Endoscope—An endoscope, as used in the field of
gastroenterology, is a thin flexible tube that uses a
lens or miniature camera to view various areas of
the gastrointestinal tract. Both diagnosis, through
biopsies or other means, and therapeutic proce-
dures can be done with this instrument.
Endoscopy—The performance of an exam using
an endoscope is known generally as endoscopy.
Lactose intolerance—An inability to properly
digest milk and dairy products.
Oral rehydration solution (ORS)—A liquid prepa-
ration developed by the World Health Organiza-
tion that can decrease fluid loss in persons with
diarrhea. Originally developed to be prepared
with materials available in the home, commercial
preparations have recently come into use.
Steatorrhea—Excessive amounts of fat in the feces.
Nutrient replacement also plays a role in preventing
and treating episodes of diarrhea. Zinc especially appears
to have an effect on the immune system, and deficiency
of this mineral can lead to chronic diarrhea. Also, zinc
replacement improves growth in young patients. Plenty
of fluids, especially water, should be taken by individuals
suffering from diarrhea to prevent dehydration. The
BRAT diet also can be useful in helping to resolve diar-
rhea. This diet limits food intake to bananas, rice, apple-
sauce, and toast. These foods provide soluble and insolu-
ble fiber without irritation. If the toast is slightly burnt,
the charcoal can help sequester toxins and pull them
from the body.
Acute homeopathic remedies can be very effective for
treating diarrhea especially in infants and young children.

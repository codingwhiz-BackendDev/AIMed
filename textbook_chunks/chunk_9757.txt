vary in severity, even within one sub-type,
and the frequency of complications changes on an indi-
vidual basis. Some individuals have negligible symptoms
while others are severely restricted in their daily life.
Extreme joint instability and scoliosis may limit a per-
sonâ€™s mobility. Most individuals will have a normal lifes-
pan. However, those with blood vessel involvement, par-
ticularly those with EDS vascular type, have an increased
risk of fatal complications.
EDS is a lifelong condition. Affected individuals
may face social obstacles related to their disease on a
daily basis. Some people with EDS have reported living
with fears of significant and painful skin ruptures,
becoming pregnant (especially those with EDS vascular
type), their condition worsening, becoming unemployed
due to physical and emotional burdens, and social
stigmatization in general.
Constant bruises, skin wounds, and trips to the hos-
pital take their toll on both affected children and their
parents. Prior to diagnosis parents of children with EDS
have found themselves under suspicion of child abuse.
Some people with EDS are not diagnosed until well
into adulthood and, in the case of EDS vascular type,
occasionally not until after death due to complications of
the disorder. Not only may the diagnosis itself be devas-
tating to the family, but in many cases other family mem-
bers find out for the first time they are at risk for being
affected.
Although individuals with EDS face significant
challenges, it is important to remember that each person
is unique with their own distinguished qualities and
potential. Persons with EDS go on to have families, to
have careers, and to be accomplished citizens, surmount-
ing the challenges of their disease.

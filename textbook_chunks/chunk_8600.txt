Because diphtheria is highly contagious and has a
short incubation period, family members and other con-
tacts of diphtheria patients must be watched for symp-
toms and tested to see if they are carriers. They are usual-
ly given antibiotics for seven days and a booster shot of
diphtheria/tetanus toxoid.
Reporting cases to public health authorities
Reporting is necessary to track potential epidemics,
to help doctors identify the specific strain of diphtheria,
and to see if resistance to penicillin or erythromycin has
developed.

Given time, the body will make antibodies to cure
itself of a cold. Most colds last a week to 10 days. Most
people start feeling better within four or five days. Occa-
sionally a cold will lead to a secondary bacterial infection
that causes strep throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, sinus
infection, or a middle ear infection. These conditions usu-
ally clear up rapidly when treated with an antibiotic.

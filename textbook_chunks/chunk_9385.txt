An otoscope is a hand-held instrument with a tiny
light and a cone-shaped attachment called an ear specu-
lum, which is used to examine the ear canal. An ear
examination is a normal part of most physical examina-
tions by a doctor or nurse. It is also done when an ear
infection or other type of ear problem is suspected.

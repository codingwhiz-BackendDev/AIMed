Patients taking opioids for pain relief can develop tol-
erance and dependence. Tolerance develops when a patient
requires increasing amounts of medication to produce pain
reduction. Dependence shows characteristic withdrawal
symptoms if medications are abruptly stopped. These
symptoms can be avoided by tapering down doses in the
event that these medications should be stopped.

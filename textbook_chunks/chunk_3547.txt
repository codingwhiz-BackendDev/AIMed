Initial treatment may consist of resting the knee
using crutches, along with aspirin, Tylenol, or a non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as
Motrin for seven to 10 days. The person should limit
sports activity until the joint is healed and may use ice
followed by heat to decrease inflammation. When the
doctor allows the patient to resume sports, a knee brace
may be prescribed in the form of a stabilizer with a hole
at the kneecap.

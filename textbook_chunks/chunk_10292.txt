Initially, a patient may only notice shortness of breath
when he or she is exercising. However, as the disease pro-
gresses, it will occur with less exertion or no exertion at
all. Emphysema patients may also develop an enlarged, or
“barrel,” chest. Other symptoms may be skipped breaths,
difficulty sleeping, morning headaches, increased diffi-
culty breathing while lying down, chronic fatigue, and
swelling of the feet, ankles, or legs. Those with emphyse-
ma are at risk for a variety of other complications result-
ing from weakened lung function, including pneumonia.

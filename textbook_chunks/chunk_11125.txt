Treatment almost always involves the immediate
establishment of an artificial airway: inserting a breath-
ing tube into the throat (intubation); or making a tiny
opening toward the base of the neck and putting a breath-
ing tube into the trachea (tracheostomy). Because the
patient’s apparent level of distress may not match the
actual severity of the situation, and because the disease’s
progression can be quite surprisingly rapid, it is prefer-
able to go ahead and place the artificial airway, rather
than adopting a wait-and-see approach.
Because epiglottitis is caused by a bacteria, antibi-
otics such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ampicillin with
sulbactam should be given through a needle placed in a
vein (intravenously). This prevents the bacteria that are
circulating throughout the bloodstream from causing
infection elsewhere in the body.

Deep breathing helps expand the lungs and forces
better distribution of the air into all sections of the lung.
The patient either sits in a chair or sits upright in bed and
inhales, pushing the abdomen out to force maximum
amounts of air into the lung. The abdomen is then con-
tracted, and the patient exhales. Deep breathing exercises
are done several times each day for short periods.

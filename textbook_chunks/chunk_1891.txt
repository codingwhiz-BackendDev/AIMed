Some cephalosporins cause diarrhea. Certain diar-
rhea medicines,
such as diphenoxylate-atropine
(Lomotil), may make the problem worse. Check with a
physician before taking any medicine for diarrhea caused
by taking cephalosporins.
Birth control pills may not work properly when
taken at the same time as cephalosporins. To prevent
pregnancy, use other methods of birth control in addi-
tion to the pills while taking cephalosporins.
Taking cephalosporins with certain other drugs may
increase the risk of excess bleeding. Among the drugs that
may have this effect when taken with cephalosporins are:
• blood thinning drugs (anticoagulants) such as warfarin
(Coumadin)
• blood viscosity reducing medicines such as pentoxi-
fylline (Trental)
• the antiseizure medicines divalproex (Depakote) and
valproic acid (Depakene)
Cephalosporins may also interact with other medi-
cines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who takes cephalosporins should let the
physician know all other medicines he or she is taking.

Fascioliasis is caused by Fasciola hepatica, the
sheep liver fluke. The fluke has a three-part life cycle that
begins when eggs from a host’s feces are deposited in
water. The eggs release free-swimming larvae
(miracidia) that infect snails. The snails then release free-
swimming larvae with tails (cercariae) that form cysts
containing larvae in the infective stage (metacercariae)
on vegetation growing in fresh water. Humans become
infected when they eat watercress, water chestnuts, or
other plants covered with the encysted metacercariae.
When a person eats contaminated plants, the cysts
are broken open in the digestive system, and the metacer-
cariae leave their cysts, pass through the wall of the
intestine, and enter the liver, where they cause inflamma-
tion and destroy tissue. After a period of 10–15 weeks in
the liver, the adult flukes move to the bile ducts and pro-
duce eggs. Acute fascioliasis is marked by abdominal
pain with headache, loss of appetite, anemia, and vomit-
ing. Some patients develop hives, muscle pains, or a yel-
low-color to the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice).
Chronic forms of the disease may produce complica-
tions, including blockage of the bile ducts or the migra-
tion of adult flukes to other parts of the body.

A healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are
low in fat, especially saturated fat, low in cholesterol,
and high in fiber. It includes plenty of fruits and vegeta-
bles and limited sodium. Some foods are low in fat but
high in cholesterol and some are low in cholesterol but
high in fat. Saturated fat raises cholesterol and, in exces-
sive amounts, increases the amount of the clot-forming
proteins in blood. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated
fats are good for the heart. Fat should comprise no more
than 30% of total daily calories.
Cholesterol, a waxy substance containing fats, is
found in foods such as meat, eggs, and other animal
products. It is also produced in the liver. Soluble fiber
can help lower cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol should be
limited to about 300 milligrams per day. Many popular
lipid-lowering drugs can reduce LDL cholesterol by an
average of 25â€“30% when used with a low-fat, low-cho-
lesterol diet.
Fruits and vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins, and
minerals. They are low-calorie and nearly fat free. Vita-
min C and beta-carotene, found in many fruits and veg-
etables, keep LDL-cholesterol from turning into a form
that damages coronary arteries.

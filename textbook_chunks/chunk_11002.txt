Enzyme theory generated further interest as the
human diet became more dependent on processed and
cooked foods. Enzymes are extremely sensitive to heat,
and temperatures above 118°F (48°C) destroy them. Mod-
ern processes of pasteurization, canning, and microwaving
are particularly harmful to the enzymes in food.
Enzyme supplements are extracted from plants like
pineapple and papaya and from the organs of cows and
pigs. The supplements are typically given in tablet or
capsule form. Pancreatic enzymes may also be given by
injection. The dosage varies with the condition being
treated. For nondigestive ailments, the supplements are
taken in the hour before meals so that they can be quickly
absorbed into the blood. For digestive ailments, the sup-
plements are taken immediately before meals accompa-
nied by a large glass of fluids. Pancreatic enzymes may
be accompanied by doses of vitamin A.

The moderate to severe dissociation that occurs in
patients with dissociative disorders is understood to
result from a set of causes:
• an innate ability to dissociate easily
• repeated episodes of severe physical or sexual abuse in
childhood
• the lack of a supportive or comforting person to coun-
teract abusive relative(s)
• the influence of other relatives with dissociative symp-
toms or disorders
The relationship of dissociative disorders to child-
hood abuse has led to intense controversy and lawsuits
concerning the accuracy of childhood memories. The
brain’s storage, retrieval, and interpretation of memories
are still not fully understood. Controversy also exists
regarding how much individuals presenting dissociative
disorders have been influenced by books and movies to
describe a certain set of symptoms (scripting).

him/her motionless. Catatonic excitement, or excessive
movement, is associated with violent behavior directed
toward oneself or others.
Features of catatonia may also be seen in Neuroleptic
Malignant Syndrome (NMS) which is an uncommon (but
potentially lethal) reaction to some medications used to
treat major mental illnesses. NMS is considered a medical
emergency since 25% of untreated cases result in death.
Catatonia can also be present in individuals suffering
from a number of other physical and emotional conditions
such as drug intoxication, depression, and schizophrenia.
It is most commonly associated with mood disorders.

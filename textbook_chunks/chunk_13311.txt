Measures to control PSP require detecting rising
numbers of algae in coastal waters by periodic micro-
scopic examination. By law, shellfish beds are closed
when levels of the toxin-producing organisms are above
acceptable standards. Cooking the shellfish does not pre-
vent this disease. Suspected cases should be reported to
public health officials.

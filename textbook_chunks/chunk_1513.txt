Cataract surgery itself is quite safe; over 90% of the
time, there are no complications. Possible complications
include intraocular infection (endophthalmitis), central
retinal inflammation (macular edema), post-operative
glaucoma, retinal detachment, bleeding under the reti-
na (choroidal hemorrhage), and tiny lens fragments in
the back (vitreous) cavity of the eye, all of which can
lead to loss of sight.

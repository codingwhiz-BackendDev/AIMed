In many cases, acute infectious diarrhea is a mild,
limited annoyance. However, worldwide acute infectious
diarrhea has a huge impact, causing over five million
deaths per year. While most deaths are among children
under five years of age in developing nations, the impact,
even in developed countries, is considerable. For exam-
ple, over 250,000 individuals are admitted to hospitals in
the United States each year because of one of these
episodes. Rapid diagnosis and proper treatment can pre-
vent much of the suffering associated with these devas-
tating illnesses.
Chronic diarrhea also has a considerable effect on
health, as well as on social and economic well being.
Patients with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel dis-
ease, and other prolonged diarrheal illnesses develop
nutritional deficiencies that diminish growth and immu-
nity. They affect social interaction and result in the loss
of many working hours.

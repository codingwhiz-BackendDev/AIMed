As with any surgery, there are risks involved. Eye
muscle surgery is relatively safe, but very rarely a cut
muscle gets lost and can not be retrieved. This, and other
serious reactions, including those caused by anesthetics,
can result in vision loss in the affected eye. Occasionally,
retinal or nerve damage occurs. Double vision is not
uncommon after eye muscle surgery. As mentioned earli-
er, glasses or vision therapy may be necessary.

the risk of rupture, too. Most aneurysms that rupture are
a half-inch or larger in diameter. Size is not the only fac-
tor, however, because smaller aneurysms also rupture.
Cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and
recreational drug use (for example, use of cocaine) have
been linked with an increased risk. The role, if any, of
high blood pressure has not been determined. Some stud-
ies have implicated high blood pressure in aneurysm for-
mation and rupture, but people with normal blood pres-
sure also experience aneurysms and SAHs. High blood
pressure may be a risk factor but not the most important
one. Pregnancy, labor, and delivery also seem to
increase the possibility that an aneurysm might rupture,
but not all doctors agree. Physical exertion and use of
oral contraceptives are not suspected causes for aneurys-
mal rupture.

Motor neurons—Nerve cells that transmit signals
from the brain or spinal cord to the muscles.
Motor unit action potentials—Spikes of electrical
activity recorded during an EMG that reflect the
number of motor units (motor neurons and the
muscle fibers they transmit signals to) activated
when the patient voluntarily contracts a muscle.
similar to a mild shock from static electricity. Evoked
potentials may also be performed for additional diagnos-
tic information. Nerve conduction velocity and evoked
potential testing are especially helpful when pain or sen-
sory complaints are more prominent than weakness.

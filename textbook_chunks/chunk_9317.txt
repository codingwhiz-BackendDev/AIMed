include a dull, throbbing cramping in the
lower abdomen that may radiate to the lower back and
thighs. In addition, some women may experience nausea
and vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, sweating, or dizzi-
ness. Cramps usually last for two or three days at the
beginning of each menstrual period. Many women often
notice their painful periods disappear after they have
their first child, probably due to the stretching of the
opening of the uterus or because the birth improves the
uterine blood supply and muscle activity.

artificial lung depends on the size of the patient; sometimes
adults need two lungs. The blood is then warmed and
returned to the patient. A steady amount of blood (called
the flow rate) is pushed through the ECMO machine every
minute. As the patient improves, the flow rate is lowered.
Many patients require heavy sedation while they are
on ECMO to lessen the amount of oxygen needed by the
muscles.
As the patient improves, the amount of ECMO sup-
port will be decreased gradually, until the machine is
turned off for a brief trial period. If the patient does well
without ECMO, the treatment is stopped.
Typically, newborns remain on ECMO for three to
seven days, although some babies need more time (espe-
cially if they have a diaphragmatic hernia). Once the
baby is off ECMO, he or she will still need a ventilator
(breathing machine) for a few days or weeks. Adults may
remain on ECMO for days to weeks, depending on the
condition of the patient, but treatment may be continued
for a longer time depending on the type of heart or lung
disease, the amount of damage to the lungs before
ECMO was begun, and the presence of any other illness-
es or health problems.

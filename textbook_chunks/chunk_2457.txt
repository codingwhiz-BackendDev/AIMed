It is estimated that one million children accidentally
overdose on drugs mistaken as candies or eat, drink, or
inhale poisonous household products each year. Infants
and toddlers are at the greatest risk for accidental poison-
ing. Activated charcoal is one of the agents most com-
monly used for these cases. It can absorb large amounts of
poisons quickly. In addition, it is non-toxic, may be stored
for a long time, and can be conveniently administered at
home. Charcoal works by binding to irritating or toxic
substances in the stomach and intestines. This prevents
the toxic drug or chemical from spreading throughout the
body. The activated charcoal with the toxic substance
bound to it is then excreted in the stool without harm to
the body. When poisoning is suspected the local poison
control center should be contacted for instructions. They
may recommend using activated charcoal, which should
be available at home so that it can be given to the poi-
soned child or pet immediately. For severe poisoning,
several doses of activated charcoal may be needed.

Three kinds of round worms cause elephantiasis filar-
iasis: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia
timori. Of these three, W. bancrofti makes up about 90% of
the cases. Man is the only known host of W. bancrofti.
Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles mosquitoes are the car-
riers of W. bancrofti. Anopheles and Mansonia mosqui-
toes are the carriers of B. malayi. In addition, Anopheles
mosquitoes are the carriers of B. timori.
Infected female mosquitoes take a blood meal from
a human, and, in doing so, introduce larval forms of the
particular parasite they carry to the person. These larvae
migrate toward a lymphatic channel, then travel to vari-
ous places within the lymphatic system, usually position-
ing themselves in or near lymph nodes throughout the
body. During this time, they mature into more developed
larvae and eventually into adult worms. Depending upon
the species of round worm, this development can take a
few months or more than a year. The adult worms grow
to about 1 in (2.5 cm) to 4 in (10 cm) long.
The adult worms can live from about three to eight
years. Some have been known to live to 20 years, and in
one case 40 years. The adult worms begin reproducing
numerous live embryos, called microfilariae. The micro-
filariae travel to the bloodstream, where they can be
ingested by a mosquito when it takes a blood meal from
the infected person. If they are not ingested by a mosqui-
to, the microfilariae die within about 12 months. If they
are ingested by a mosquito, they continue to mature.
They are totally dependent on their specific species of
mosquito to develop further. The cycle continues when
the mosquito takes another blood meal.
Most of the symptoms an infected person experi-
ences are due to the blockage of the lymphatic system by
the adult worms and due to the substances (excretions
and secretions) produced by the worms.

Some side effects, such as loss of appetite, nausea
and vomiting, stomach cramps, diarrhea and dizziness,
usually lessen or go away as the body adjusts to the med-
icine. These problems do not need medical attention
unless they continue or interfere with normal activities.
Patients taking potassium-sparing diuretics should
know the signs of too much potassium and should check
with a physician as soon as possible if any of these symp-
toms occur:
• irregular heartbeat
• breathing problems
• numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or lips

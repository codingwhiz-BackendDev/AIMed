Serious or recurrent urinary infections will prompt a
search for underlying abnormalities. Cystoscopy (look-
ing into the bladder with a thin telescope-like instrument)
and x rays with a contrast agent to illuminate the urinary
system will usually identify the defect. Computed
tomography scans (CT) and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scans may provide additional informa-
tion. Urine cultures to identify the infecting germs will
be repeated frequently until the problem is corrected.

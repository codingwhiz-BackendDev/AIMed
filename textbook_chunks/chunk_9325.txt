Secondary dysmenorrhea is controlled by treating
the underlying disorder.
Several drugs can lessen or completely eliminate
the pain of primary dysmenorrhea. The most popular
choice are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), which prevent or decrease the formation of
prostaglandins. These include aspirin,
ibuprofen
(Advil), and naproxen (Aleve). For more severe pain,
prescription strength ibuprofen (Motrin) is available.
These drugs are usually begun at the first sign of the
period and taken for a day or two. There are many dif-
ferent types of NSAIDs, and women may find that one
works better for them than the others.
If an NSAID is not available, acetaminophen
(Tylenol) may also help ease the pain. Heat applied to the
painful area may bring relief, and a warm bath twice a
day also may help. While birth control pills will ease the
pain of dysmenorrhea because they lead to lower hor-
mone levels, they are not usually prescribed just for pain
management unless the woman also wants to use them
as a birth control method. This is because these pills may
carry other more significant side effects and risks.
New studies of a drug patch containing glyceryl
trinitrate to treat dysmenorrhea suggest that it also may
help ease pain. This drug has been used in the past to
ease preterm contractions in pregnant women.

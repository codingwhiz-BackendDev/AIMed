Most bladder infections in women are so-called
ascending infections, which means that they are caused
by disease agents traveling upward through the urethra to
the bladder. The relative shortness of the female urethra
(1.2–2 in in length) makes it easy for bacteria to gain
entry to the bladder and multiply. The most common bac-
teria associated with UTIs in women include Escherichia
coli (about 80% of cases), Staphylococcus saprophyticus,
Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus species. Risk fac-
tors for UTIs in women include:
• Sexual intercourse. The risk of infection increases if the
woman has multiple partners.
• Use of a diaphragm for contraception
• An abnormally short urethra
• Diabetes or chronic dehydration
• The absence of a specific enzyme (fucosyltransferase)
in vaginal secretions. The lack of this enzyme makes it
easier for the vagina to harbor bacteria that cause UTIs.
• Inadequate personal hygiene. Bacteria from fecal matter
or vaginal discharges can enter the female urethra
because its opening is very close to the vagina and anus.
• History of previous UTIs. About 80% of women with
cystitis develop recurrences within two years.
The early symptoms of cystitis in women are
dysuria, or pain on urination; urgency, or a sudden
strong desire to urinate; and increased frequency of uri-
nation. About 50% of female patients experience fever,
pain in the lower back or flanks, nausea and vomiting,
or shaking chills. These symptoms indicate pyelonephri-
tis, or spread of the infection to the upper urinary tract.

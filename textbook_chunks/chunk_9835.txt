The TENS device is a small battery-powered stimu-
lator that produces low-intensity electrical signals through
electrodes on or near a painful area, producing a tingling
sensation that reduces pain. There is no dosage limitation,
and the patient controls the amount of pain relief.
Some experts believe TENS works by blocking pain
signals in the spinal cord, or by delivering electrical
impulses to underlying nerve fibers that lessen the expe-
rience of pain. Others suspect that the electrical stimula-
tion triggers the release of natural painkillers in the body.
Patients can rent a TENS unit before buying one, to
see if it is effective against their pain.

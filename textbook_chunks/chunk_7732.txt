Most dental trauma is preventable. Car seat belts
should always be worn, and young children should be
secured in appropriate car seats. Homes should be moni-
tored for potential tripping and slipping hazards. Child-
proofing measures should be taken, especially for tod-
dlers. In addition to placing gates across stairs and
padding sharp table edges, electrical cords should be
tucked away. Young children may receive severe oral
burns from gnawing on live power cords.
Everyone who participates in contact sports should
wear a mouthguard to avoid dental trauma. Athletes in
football, ice hockey, wrestling, and boxing commonly
wear mouthguards. The mandatory use of mouthguards
in football prevents about 200,000 oral injuries annually.
Mouthguards should also be worn along with helmets in
noncontact sports such as skateboarding, in-line skating,

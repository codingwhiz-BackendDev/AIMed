Echinacea is a North American prairie native, abun-
dant in the Midwest, and cultivated widely in ornamental
and medicinal gardens. The purple-pink rays of the blos-
som droop downward from a brassy hued center cone
composed of many small, tubular florets. The conspicu-
ous flowers bloom singly on stout, prickly stems from
mid-summer to autumn. Flower heads may grow to 4 in
(10.16 cm) across. The dark green leaves are opposite,
entire, lanceolate, toothed, and hairy with three promi-
nent veins. The narrow upper leaves are attached to the
stem with stalks. The lower leaves are longer, emerging
from the stem without a leaf stalk, and growing to 8 in
(20.32 cm) in length. The plant develops deep, slender,
black roots. Echinacea propagates easily from seed or by
root cuttings. However, due to its increasing popularity
as an herbal supplement, echinacea is numbered among
the 19 medicinal plants considered at risk by the Vermont
nonprofit organization, United Plant Savers.

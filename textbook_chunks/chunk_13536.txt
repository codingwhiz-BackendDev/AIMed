To correct a folic acid deficiency, supplements are
taken in addition to food. Since the functioning of the B
vitamins is interrelated, it is generally recommended that
the appropriate dose of B-complex vitamins be taken in
place of single B vitamin supplements. The Recom-
mended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for folate is 400 mcg
per day for adults, 600 mcg per day for pregnant women,
and 500 mcg for nursing women. Medicinal dosages of
up to 1,000-2,000 mcg per day may be prescribed.

The laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves the inser-
tion of a long narrow cylindrical tube with a camera on
the end, through an approximately 1 cm incision in the
abdomen, which allows visualization of the internal
organs and projection of this image onto a video monitor.
Three smaller incisions allow for insertion of other instru-
ments to perform the surgical procedure. A laser may be
used for the incision and cautery (burning unwanted tis-
sue to stop bleeding), in which case the procedure may be
called laser laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
In a conventional or open cholecystectomy, the gall-
bladder is removed through a surgical incision high in the
right abdomen, just beneath the ribs. A drain may be insert-
ed to prevent accumulation of fluid at the surgical site.

As mentioned, the majority of diverticula do not
cause any symptoms, and are often found by coincidence
during an examination being performed for some other
medical condition.
When diverticula are suspected because a patient
begins to have sudden rectal bleeding, the location of the
bleeding can be studied by performing an angiography.
Angiography involves inserting a tiny tube through an
artery in the leg, and moving it up into one of the major
arteries of the gastrointestinal system. A particular chem-
ical (contrast medium) which will show up on x-ray
films is injected, and the area of bleeding is located by
looking for an area where the contrast is leaking into the
interior (lumen) of the intestine.
A procedure called endoscopy provides another
method for examining the colon and locating the site of
bleeding. In endoscopy, a small, flexible scope (endo-
scope) is inserted through the rectum and into the intes-
tine. The scope usually bears a fiber-optic camera, which
allows the view through this endoscope to be projected
onto a television screen. The operator can introduce the
endoscope further and further through the intestine to
find the location of the bleeding.

None

Autosomal—Refers to the 22 pairs (in humans) of
chromosomes not involved with sex determination.
Connective tissue—Tissue that supports and binds
other tissue; much of it occurs outside of cells
(extra-cellular) and consists of fibrous webs of the
polymers, elastin and collagen. Cutis laxa is associ-
ated with defects in these fibers.
Diverticula—Pouches in the walls of organs.
Dominant trait—A genetic trait where one copy of
the gene is sufficient to yield an outward display of
the trait; dominant genes mask the presence of
recessive genes; dominant traits can be inherited
from only one parent.
Duodenum—The uppermost part of the small intes-
tine, about 10 in (25 cm) long.
Esophagus—The tube connecting the throat to the
stomach, about 10 in (25 cm) long.
Funnel breast (also known as pectus excavatum)—
A condition where there is a hollow depression in
the lower part of the chest.
Gene—A portion of a DNA molecule that either
codes for a protein or RNA molecule or has a regu-
latory function.
Lysyl oxidase—An enzyme required for the crosslink-
ing of elastin and collagen molecules to form proper-
ly functioning connective tissue; present in relatively
low levels in at least some forms of cutis laxa.
Pigeon breast (also known as pectus carinatum)—
A chest shape with a central projection resembling
the keel of a boat.
Recessive trait—An inherited trait that is outwardly
obvious only when two copies of the gene for that
trait are present; an individual displaying a reces-
sive trait must have inherited one copy of the defec-
tive gene from each parent.
Sex-linked—Refers to genes or traits carried on one
of the sex chromosomes, usually the X.
Tortuous arteries—Arteries with many bends and
twists.
X chromosome—One of the two types of sex chro-
mosomes; females have two X chromosomes, while
males have one X chromosome and one Y chromo-
some.

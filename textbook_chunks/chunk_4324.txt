Most profoundly, deaf patients who receive an
implant are able to discern medium and loud sounds,
including speech, at comfortable listening levels. Many
use sound clues from the implant, together with speech
reading and other facial cues. Almost all adults improve
their communication skills when combining the implant
with speech reading (lip reading), and some can under-
stand spoken words without speech reading. More than
half of adults who lost hearing after they learned to speak
can understand some speech without speech reading.
About 30% can understand spoken sounds well enough
to use the phone.
Children who were born deaf or who lost their hear-
ing before they could speak have the most difficulty in
learning to use the implant. Research suggests, however,
that most of these children are able to learn spoken lan-
guage and understand speech using the implant.

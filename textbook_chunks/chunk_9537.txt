Treatment depends on the size and location of cysts,
as well as the symptoms they are producing. Surgical
removal of cysts and/or surrounding tissue is the accept-
ed method of treatment, but carries a risk of cyst rupture
with spread or allergic reactions. Recent studies using
medication alongside aspiration and drainage of cysts
instead of surgery are very encouraging.
The medication albenzadole can be taken before or
after surgery or alone without surgery. However, its
effectiveness as a single treatment is still not known.
Multiple courses of medication are often necessary,
with cure rates of only about 30%. Response to treat-
ment is best monitored by serial CT scans or similar x-
ray studies.

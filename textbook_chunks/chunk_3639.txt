Of women who undergo transcervical chorionic vil-
lus sampling, one third experience minimal vaginal spot-
ting and 7–10% experience vaginal bleeding. One out of
five women experience cramping following the proce-
dure. Two to three women out of 100 (or 2–3%) will mis-
carry following chorionic villus sampling. The risk of
infection is very low. Rupture of the amniotic mem-
branes is a rare complication. Women with Rh negative
blood may be at an increased risk for developing Rh
incompatibility following chorionic villus sampling.
There have been reports of limb defects in babies
following chorionic villus sampling. However, in 1996
the World Health Organization reported that the inci-
dence of babies born with limb defects from 138,966
women who had undergone chorionic villus sampling
was the same as for women who had not. Therefore, this
study found no connection between chorionic villus sam-
pling and limb defects.

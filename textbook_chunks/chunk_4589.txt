The procedure is virtually free of any complications
and risks. Very rarely (two in 1000 cases) there may be a
perforation (a hole) in the intestinal wall. Heavy bleeding
due to the removal of the polyp or from the biopsy site
occurs very infrequently (one in 1000 cases). Infections
due to a colonoscopy are also extremely rare. Patients
with artificial or abnormal heart valves are usually given
antibiotics before and after the procedure to prevent an
infection.

The cornea has a remarkable ability to heal itself, so
treatment is designed to minimize complications. If the
abrasion is very small, the doctor might just suggest an
eye lubricant and a follow-up visit the next day. A very
small abrasion should heal in one to two days; others
usually in one week. However, to avoid a possible infec-
tion, an antibiotic eye drop may be prescribed. Some-
times additional eye drops may make the eye feel more
comfortable. Depending upon the extent of the abrasion,
some doctors may patch the affected eye. It is very
important to go for the follow-up checkup to make sure
an infection does not occur. Use of contact lenses should
not be resumed without the doctorâ€™s approval.

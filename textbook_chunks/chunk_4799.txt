It is not possible to prevent colds because the viruses
that cause colds are common and highly infectious. How-
ever, there are some steps individuals can take to reduce
their spread. These include:
• washing hands well and frequently, especially after
touching the nose or before handling food
• covering the mouth and nose when sneezing
• disposing of used tissues properly
• avoiding close contact with someone who has a cold
during the first two to four days of their infection
• not sharing food, eating utensils, or cups with anyone
• avoiding crowded places where cold germs can spread
• eating a healthy diet and getting adequate sleep

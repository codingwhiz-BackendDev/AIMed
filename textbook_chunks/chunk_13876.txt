Fractures usually result from a traumatic injury to a bone where the continuity of bone tissues or bony cartilage is disrupted
or broken.The illustrations above feature common sites where fractures occur. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
tory and physical exam by a physician often reveals the
presence of a fracture. An x ray of the injured area is the
most common test used to determine the presence of a
bone fracture. Any x ray series performed involves at
least two views of the area to confirm the presence of the
fracture because not all fractures are apparent on a single
x-ray. Some fractures are often difficult to see and may
require several views at different angles to see clear frac-
ture lines. In some cases, CT, MRI or other imaging tests
are required to demonstrate fracture. Sometimes, espe-
cially with children, the initial x ray may not show any
fractures but repeat x rays seven to 14 days later may
show changes in the bone(s) of the affected area. If a
fracture is open and occurs in conjunction with soft tis-
sue injury, further laboratory studies are often conducted
to determine if blood loss has occurred.
In the event of exercise-related stress fractures
(micro-fractures due to excessive stress), a tuning fork
can provide a simple, inexpensive test. The tuning fork is

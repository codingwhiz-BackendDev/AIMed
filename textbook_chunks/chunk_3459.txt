Studies in animals and humans suggest that gemfi-
brozil increases the risk of some types of cancer. The drug
may also cause gallstones or muscle problems. Patients
who need to take this medicine should ask their physi-
cians for the latest information on its benefits and risks.
Patients taking gemfibrozil should check with a
physician immediately if any of these side effects occur:
• fever or chills
• severe stomach pain with nausea and vomiting
• pain in the lower back or side
• pain or difficulty when urinating
• cough or hoarseness

These drugs may damage the liver or muscles.
Patients who take the drugs should have blood tests to
check for liver damage as often as their physician recom-
mends. Any unexplained pain, tenderness or weakness in
the muscles should be reported to the physician at once.
All cholesterol-reducing drugs
Minor side effects such as heartburn, indigestion,
belching, bloating, gas, nausea or vomiting, stomach
pain, dizziness and headache usually go away as the
body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical treat-
ment unless they continue or they interfere with normal
activities.
Patients who have constipation while taking choles-
terol-reducing drugs should bring the problem to a physi-
cian’s attention as soon as possible.
Additional side effects are possible. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms while taking cholesterol-reducing
drugs should get in touch with his or her physician.

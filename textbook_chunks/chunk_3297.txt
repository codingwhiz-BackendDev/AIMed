Cholera is an acute illness characterized by watery
diarrhea that is caused by the bacterium Vibrio
cholerae. Cholera is spread by eating food or drinking
water contaminated with the bacteria. Although cholera
was a public health problem in the United States and
Europe a hundred years ago, modern sanitation and the
treatment of drinking water have virtually eliminated the
disease in developed countries. In third world countries,
however, cholera is still common.

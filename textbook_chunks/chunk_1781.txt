Description
Throughout history, humans have sought relief from
anxiety and insomnia by using substances that depress
brain activity and induce a drowsy or calming effect. CNS
depressants include a wide range of drugs such as alcohol,
narcotics, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal), ben-
zodiazepines (Ativan, Halcion, Librium, Valium, Xanax),
chloral hydrate, and methaqualone (Quaaludes), as well as
newer CNS depressants developed in the 1990s, such as
Buspirone (Buspar) and Zolpidem (Ambien), which are
thought to have the fewest sideeffects. Most CNS depres-
sants activate a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobu-
tyric acid (GABA), which helps decrease brain activity.
Street names for CNS depressants include Reds,Yellows,
Blues, Ludes, Barbs, and Downers.

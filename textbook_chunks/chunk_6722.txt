CTCL, also known as mycosis fungoides, is a cancer
of the white blood cells that primarily affects the skin and
only secondarily affects other sites. This disease involves
the uncontrollable proliferation of T-lymphocytes known
as T-helper cells, so named because of their role in the
immune response. T-helper cells are characterized by the
presence of a protein receptor on its surface called CD4.
Accordingly, T-helper cells are said to be CD4+.
The proliferation of T-helper cells results in the pen-
etration, or infiltration, of these abnormal cells into the
epidermal layer of the skin. The skin reacts with slightly
scaling lesions that itch, although the sites of greatest
infiltration do not necessarily correspond to the sites of
the lesions. The lesions are most often located on the
trunk, but can be present on any part of the body. In the
most common course of the disease, the patchy lesions
progress to palpable plaques that are deeper red and have
more defined edges. As the disease worsens, skin tumors
develop that are often mushroom-shaped, hence the
name mycosis fungoides. Finally, the cancer progresses
to extracutanous involvement, often in the lymph nodes
or the viscera.
CTCL is a rare disease, with an annual incidence of
about 0.29 cases per 100,000 persons in the United
States. It is about half as common in Eastern Europe.
However, this discrepancy may be attributed to a differ-
ing physician awareness of the disease rather than a true
difference in occurrence. In the Unites States, there are
about 500 to 600 new cases a year and about 100 to 200
deaths. Usually seen in older adults, the median age at
diagnosis is 55 to 60 years, and it strikes twice as many
men as women.

As with many birth defects, the causes are not well
known. Lack of prenatal care and nutrition has been
linked to many birth defects; however, beyond the avoid-
ance of known teratogens (anything that can cause a birth
defect), there is little prevention possible. Exstrophy is
rare, occurring in about one in 40,000 births. Diverticula
are more common, but less serious.
If left untreated, the patient with bladder exstrophy
will have no control over urination and is more likely to
develop bladder cancer. Diverticula, particularly if it
causes urine reflux, may lead to chronic infection and its
subsequent consequences.

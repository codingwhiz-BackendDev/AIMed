Biochemical, hormonal, and vascular changes
induce cluster headaches, but why these changes occur
remains unclear. Episodic cluster headaches seem to be
linked to changes in day length, possibly signaling a con-
nection to the so-called biological clock. Alcohol, tobac-
co, histamine, or stress can trigger cluster headaches.
Decreased blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) can also act
as a trigger, particularly during the night when an indi-
vidual is sleeping. Interestingly, the triggers do not cause
cluster headaches during remission periods.
The primary cluster headache symptom is excruciat-
ing one-sided head pain centered behind an eye or near
the temple. This pain may radiate outward from the ini-
tial focus and encompass the mouth and teeth. For this
reason, some cluster headache sufferers may mistakenly
attribute their pain to a dental problem. Secondary symp-
toms, occurring on the same side as the pain, include eye
tearing, nasal congestion followed by a runny nose, pupil
contraction, and facial drooping or flushing.

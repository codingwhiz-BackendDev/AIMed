Patients who have undergone a cystoscopy will be
instructed to follow these steps to ensure a quick recovery:
• due to soreness or discomfort that may occur in the ure-
thra, especially while urinating, several warm baths a
day are recommended to relieve any pain
• allow four days for recovery
• blood may appear in the urine—this is common, and soon
clears up in one to two days following the procedure
• avoid strenuous exercise for a minimum of two weeks
following surgery
• sexual relations may continue when the urologist deter-
mines that healing is complete
• wait at least two days after surgery before driving
Patients may also be prescribed pain relievers and
antibiotics following surgery. Minor pain may also be
treated with over-the-counter, non-prescription drugs
such as acetaminophen.

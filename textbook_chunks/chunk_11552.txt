This study is designed to measure the pressure
changes produced by contraction of the muscular por-
tions of the esophagus. An abnormality in the function of
any one of the segments of the swallowing tube causes
difficulty in swallowing. Doctors call this symptom dys-
phagia. This exam is most useful in evaluating those
patients whose endoscopy is negative.
During manometry, the patient swallows a thin tube
carrying a device that senses changes in pressures in the
esophagus. Readings are taken at rest and during swal-
lowing. Medications are sometimes given during the
study to help in the diagnosis. The results are then trans-
mitted to recording equipment. Manometry can best
identify diseases that produce disturbances of motility or
contractions of the esophagus.

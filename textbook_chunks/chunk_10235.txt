In a pulmonary embolism, a common illness, blood
flow is blocked at a pulmonary artery. When emboli block
the main pulmonary artery, and in cases where there are
no initial symptoms, a pulmonary embolism can quickly
become fatal. According to the American Heart Associa-
tion, an estimated 600,000 Americans develop pulmonary
emboli annually and 60,000 die from it.
A pulmonary embolism is difficult to diagnose. Less
than 10% of patients who die from a pulmonary
embolism were diagnosed with the condition. More than
90% of cases of pulmonary emboli are complications of
deep vein thrombosis, blood clots in the deep vein of
the leg or pelvis.

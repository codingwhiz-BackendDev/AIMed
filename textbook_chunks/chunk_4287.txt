Diagnosis of fracture is usually made by inserting a
gloved finger in the rectum and pressing on the coccyx.
X rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also
often used. Since coccyx pain may be the result of other
factors like cancer, these must be ruled out through a
variety of tests before treatment can begin.

toms of rejection include persistent discomfort, sensitivi-
ty to light, redness, or a change in vision.
If a rejection reaction does occur, it can usually be
blocked by steroid treatment. Rejection reactions may
become noticeable within weeks after surgery, but may
not occur until 10 or even 20 years after the transplant.
When full rejection does occur, the surgery will usually
need to be repeated.
Although the cornea is not normally vascular, some
corneal diseases cause vascularization (the growth of
blood vessels) into the cornea. In patients with these con-
ditions, careful testing of both donor and recipient is per-
formed just as in transplantation of other organs and tis-
sues such as hearts, kidneys, and bone marrow. In such
patients, repeated surgery is sometimes necessary in
order to achieve a successful transplant.
Cornea donors are carefully screened. Individuals
with infectious diseases are not accepted as donors.

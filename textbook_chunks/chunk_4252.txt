Many cases of coccidioidomycosis go undiagnosed
because the symptoms resemble those of common viral
diseases. However, a skin test similar to that for tubercu-
losis will determine whether a person has been infected.
The test is simple and accurate, but it does not indicate
whether the disease was limited to its acute form or if it
has progressed to its chronic form.

Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. The
inflammation is a reaction of the body’s immune system
to infection or invasion. During the inflammation, the
brain’s tissues become swollen. The combination of the
infection and the immune reaction to it can cause
headache and a fever, as well as more severe symptoms
in some cases.
Approximately 2,000 cases of encephalitis are
reported to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
GA each year. The viruses causing primary encephalitis
can be epidemic or sporadic. The polio virus is an epi-
demic cause. Arthropod-borne viral encephalitis is
responsible for most epidemic viral encephalitis. The
viruses live in animal hosts and mosquitos that transmit
the disease. The most common form of non-epidemic or
sporadic encephalitis is caused by the herpes simplex
virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and has a high rate of death.
Mumps is another example of a sporadic cause.

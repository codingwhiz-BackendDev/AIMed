PSP develops usually within minutes after eating a
contaminated shellfish, most commonly a mussel, clam,
or oyster. Symptoms include headache, a floating feel-
ing, dizziness, lack of coordination, and tingling of the
mouth, arms, or legs. Muscle weakness causing difficulty
swallowing or speaking may occur. Abdominal symptoms
such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can also occur.
Unlike ciguatera and scombroid, PSP may have a much
more serious outcome. PSP may cause difficulty breath-
ing related to weakness or paralysis of the breathing
muscle. The symptoms may last for six to 12 hours, but a
patient may continue to feel weak for a week or more.

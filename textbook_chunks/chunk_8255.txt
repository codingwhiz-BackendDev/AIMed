Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients
are at risk for infection. Hemodialysis patients should
keep their access sites clean and watch for signs of red-
ness and warmth that could indicate infection. Peritoneal
dialysis patients must follow the same precautions with
their catheter. Peritonitis, an infection of the peritoneum,
causes flu-like symptoms and can disrupt dialysis treat-
ments if not caught early.

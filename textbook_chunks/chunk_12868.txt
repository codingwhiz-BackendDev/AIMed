Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying pigment found
in red blood cells. It is a large molecule made in the bone
marrow from two components, heme and globin.
Defects in hemoglobin production may be either
genetic or acquired. The genetic defects are further sub-
divided into errors of heme production (porphyria), and
those of globin production (known collectively as the
hemoglobinopathies).
There are two categories of hemoglobinopathy. In
the first category, abnormal globin chains give rise to
abnormal hemoglobin molecules. In the second category,
normal hemoglobin chains are produced but in abnormal
amounts. An example of the first category is the disorder
of sickle cell anemia, the inherited condition character-
ized by curved (sickle-shaped) red blood cells and chron-
ic hemolytic anemia. Disorders in the second category
are called the thalassemias, which are further divided
into types according to which amino acid chain is affect-
ed (alpha or beta), and whether there is one defective
gene (thalassemia minor) or two defective genes (tha-
lassemia major).

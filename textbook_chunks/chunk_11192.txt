The test is primarily used to detect whether first time
infection (called primary infection) with the Epstein-Barr
virus is currently occurring, or has occurred within a
short period of time. The pattern of the antibodies detect-
ed can, however, tell if the person has never been infect-
ed with the Epstein-Barr virus, or if the infection
occurred in the more distant past. These tests are mostly
utilized in the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-associated
infectious mononucleosis when the more common diag-
nostic test, the heterophile antibody, is negative, or in sit-
uations where the infection is manifesting unusual symp-
toms. Therefore, the tests are often not needed in a situa-

test) is positive.
In addition, Epstein-Barr virus testing is usually not
needed in the evaluation of a patient who has long-last-
ing fatigue, and may have the chronic fatigue syn-
drome. Initially, it was thought that discovering a partic-
ular pattern of antibodies to this virus was helpful in the
diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, but this no longer
appears to be the case.

The prognosis is variable; many infants with DiGe-
orge syndrome die from overwhelming infection,
seizures, or heart failure within the first year. Advances
in heart surgery indicate that the prognosis is most close-
ly linked to the severity of the heart defects and the par-
tial presence of the thymus gland. In most children who
survive, the number of T cells, a type of white blood cell,
in the blood rises spontaneously as they mature. Sur-
vivors are likely to be mentally retarded, however, and to
have other developmental difficulties, including psychi-
atric problems in later life.

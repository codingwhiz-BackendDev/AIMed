Corneal transplants are highly successful, with over
90% of operations in United States achieving restoration
of sight. However, there is always some risk associated
with any surgery. Complications that can occur include
infection, glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataract for-
mation, and rejection of the donor cornea.
Graft rejection occurs in 5–30% of patients, a com-
plication possible with any procedure involving tissue
transplantation from another person (allograft). Allograft
rejection results from a reaction of the patient’s immune
system to the donor tissue. Cell surface proteins called
histocompatibility antigens trigger this reaction. These
antigens are often associated with vascular tissue (blood
vessels) within the graft tissue. Since the cornea normal-
ly contains no blood vessels, it experiences a very low
rate of rejection. Generally, blood typing and tissue typ-
ing are not needed in corneal transplants, and no close
match between donor and recipient is required. Symp-

Coronary artery disease, also called coronary heart
disease or heart disease, is the leading cause of death for
both men and women in the United States. According to
the American Heart Association, in 1995 one in every 4.8
deaths in the United States was caused by coronary artery
disease. About every 29 seconds, one American will have
a heart attack; about every minute, one American will die
from a heart attack. Fourteen million Americans have
active symptoms of coronary artery disease (heart attack
or chest pains). Many millions more have silent coronary
disease, the first indication of which can be sudden death.
Coronary artery disease occurs when the coronary
arteries become partially blocked or clogged. This block-
age limits the flow of blood from the coronary arteries,
which are the major arteries supplying oxygen-rich blood
to the heart. The coronary arteries expand when the heart
is working harder and needs more oxygen. Arteries
would expand, for example, when a person is climbing
stairs, exercising, or having sex. If the arteries are unable
to expand, the heart is deprived of oxygen (myocardial
ischemia). When the blockage is limited, chest pain or
pressure, called angina, may occur. When the blockage
cuts off the flow of blood, the result is heart attack
(myocardial infarction or heart muscle death).
Healthy coronary arteries are clean, smooth, and
slick. The artery walls are flexible and can expand to let
more blood through when the heart needs to work harder.
The disease process in arteries is thought to begin with
an injury to the linings and walls of the arteries. This
injury makes them susceptible to atherosclerosis and
blood clots (thrombosis).

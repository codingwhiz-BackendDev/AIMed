Normal values can vary from laboratory to laborato-
ry, but are generally in the following ranges:
• Adult female: 0.5–1.1 mg/dL
• Adult male: 0.6–1.2 mg/dL
• Adolescent: 0.5–1.0 mg/dL
• Child: 0.3–0.7 mg/dL
• Infant: 0.2–0.4 mg/dL
• Newborn: 0.3–1.2 mg/dL
Note that variations between sources for serum crea-
tinine normal ranges are greater than for other important
tests. For example, due to the greater amount of muscle

higher creatinine levels than females. Also, because the
kidney filtration rate normally increases in pregnancy,
serum creatinine should be slightly less during such peri-

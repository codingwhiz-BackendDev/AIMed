Agglutinin—An antibody that causes red blood
cells to stick or clump together.
Antibody—A protein molecule produced by the
immune system that is specific to a disease agent,
such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The antibody
combines with the organism and disables it.
Autoantibody—An antibody produced by the
body in reaction to any of its own cells or cell
products.
Cold agglutinins—Antibodies that cause clumping
of red blood cells when the blood temperature falls
below normal body temperature (98.6°F/37°C).
Hemolytic anemia—Oxygen deficiency in the
blood, caused by shortened survival of red blood
cells.
Mycoplasma—A type of free-living microorganism
that has no cell wall. Mycoplasmas cause some
varieties of pneumonia and urinary tract infections
that stimulate the body to produce cold agglutinins.
Titer—The concentration of a substance in a given
sample of blood or other tissue fluid.
cools the tube in ice water for 30–60 seconds, and looks
for clumping of red blood cells. If the cells clump after
chilling and unclump as they rewarm, a cold agglutinin
titer (concentration) greater than 1:64 is present. Bedside
test results, however, should be confirmed by a laborato-
ry. The laboratory test measures the clumping of red
blood cells in different dilutions of the patient’s blood
serum at 39.2°F (4°C).

Prognoses for dissociative disorders vary. Recovery
from dissociative fugue is usually rapid. Dissociative
amnesia may resolve quickly, but can become a chronic
disorder in some patients. Depersonalization disorder,
DDNOS, and DID are usually chronic conditions. DID
usually requires five or more years of treatment for
recovery.

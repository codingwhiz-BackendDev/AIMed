Cerebrospinal fluid analysis—A analysis that is
important in diagnosing diseases of the central
nervous system. The fluid within the spine will
indicate the presence of viruses, bacteria, and
blood. Infections such as encephalitis will be indi-
cated by an increase of cell count and total pro-
tein in the fluid.
Computerized tomography (CT) Scan—A test to
examine organs within the body and detect evi-
dence of tumors, blood clots, and accumulation of
fluids.
Electroencephalagram (EEG)—A chart of the brain
waves picked up by the electrodes placed on the
scalp. Changes in brain wave activity can be an
indication of nervous system disorders.
Inflammation—A response from the immune sys-
tem to an injury. The signs are redness, heat,
swelling, and pain.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)—MRI is diag-
nostic radiography using electromagnetic energy
to create an image of the central nervous system
(CNS), blood system, and musculoskeletal system.
Vaccine—A prepartation containing killed or
weakened microorganisms used to build immuni-
ty against infection from that microorganism.
Virus—A very small organism that can only live
within a cell. They are unable to reproduce out-
side that cell.
Vaccines are available against some viruses, includ-
ing polio, herpes B, Japanese encephalitis, and equine
encephalitis. Rabies vaccine is available for animals; it is
also given to people after exposure. Japanese encephalitis
vaccine is recommended for those traveling to Asia and
staying in affected rural areas during transmission season.

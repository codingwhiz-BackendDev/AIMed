Normal results include recovery from the surgery
with few or no complications. About 95% of people with
ostomies recover completely, are able to return to work,
and consider themselves to be in good health. Many

foods rather than living on a restricted diet. Some
patients, however, need to be referred to psychotherapists
to deal with depression or other emotional problems after
the operation.

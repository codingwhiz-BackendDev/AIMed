Coma is a medical emergency, and attention must
first be directed to maintaining the patientâ€™s respiration
and circulation, using intubation aand ventilation, admin-
istration of intravenous fluids or blood as needed, and
other supportive care. If head trama has not been exclud-
ed, the neck should be stablized in the event of fracture. It
is obviously extremely important for a physician to deter-
mine quickly the cause of a coma, so that potentially
reversible conditions are treated immediately. For exam-
ple, an infection may be treated with antibiotics; a brain
tumor may be removed; and brain swelling from an
injury can be reduced with certain medications. Various
metabolic disorders can be addressed by supplying the
individual with the correct amount of oxygen, glucose, or
sodium; by treating the underlying disease in liver dis-
ease, asthma, or diabetes; and by halting seizures with
medication. Because of their low incidence of side effects
and potential for prompt reversal of coma in certain con-
ditions, glucose, the B-vitamin thiamine, and Narcan (to
counteract any narcotic-type drugs) are routinely given.

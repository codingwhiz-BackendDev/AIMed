Carbohydrate intolerance caused by temporary
intestinal diseases disappears when the condition is suc-
cessfully treated. In primary conditions, no treatment
exists to improve the bodyâ€™s ability to produce the
enzymes, but symptoms can be controlled by diet.
Because the degree of lactose intolerance varies so
much, treatment should be tailored for the individual.
Young children showing signs of intolerance should
avoid milk products; infants should switch to soy-based
formula. Older children and adults can adjust their intake
of lactose depending on how much and what they can
tolerate. For some, a small glass of milk will not cause
problems, while others may be able to handle ice cream
or aged cheeses such as cheddar or Swiss, but not other
dairy products. Generally, small amounts of lactose-con-
taining foods taken throughout the day are better tolerat-
ed than a large amount consumed all at once.
For those individuals who are sensitive to even very
small amounts of lactose, the lactase enzyme is available
without a prescription. It comes in liquid form for use
with milk. The addition of a few drops to a quart of milk
will reduce the lactose content by 70% after 24 hours in
the refrigerator. Heating the milk speeds up the process,
and doubling the amount of lactase liquid will result in
milk that is 90% lactose free. Chewable lactase enzyme
tablets are also available. Three to six tablets taken
before a meal or snack will aid in the digestion of solid
foods. Lactose-reduced milk and other products are also
available in stores. The milk contains the same nutrients
as regular milk.
Because dairy products are an important source of
calcium, people who reduce or severely limit their intake
of dairy products may need to consider other ways to
consume an adequate amount of calcium in their diets.

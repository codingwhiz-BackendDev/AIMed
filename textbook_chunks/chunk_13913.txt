Fragile X syndrome is also known as Martin-Bell syn-
drome, Marker X syndrome, and FRAXA syndrome. It is
the most common form of inherited mental retardation.
Fragile X syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR-1
gene, located on the X chromosome. The role of the gene is
unclear, but it is probably important in early development.
In order to understand fragile X syndrome it is
important to understand how human genes and chromo-
somes influence this condition. Normally, each cell in the
body contains 46 (23 pairs of) chromosomes. These
chromosomes consist of genetic material (DNA) needed
for the production of proteins, which lead to growth,
development, and physical/intellectual characteristics.
The first 22 pairs of chromosomes are the same in males
and females. The remaining two chromosomes are called
the sex chromosomes (X and Y). The sex chromosomes
determine whether a person is male or female. Males
have only one X chromosome, which is inherited from
the mother at conception, and they receive a Y chromo-
some from the father. Females inherit two X chromo-
somes, one from each parent. Fragile X syndrome is
caused by a mutation in a gene called FMR-1. This gene
is located on the X chromosome. The FMR-1 gene is
thought to play an important role in the development of
the brain, but the exact way that the gene acts in the body
is not fully understood.
Fragile X syndrome affects males and females of all
ethnic groups. It is estimated that there are about one in
4,000 to one in 6,250 males affected with fragile X syn-
drome. There are approximately half as many females with
fragile X syndrome as there are males. The carrier frequen-
cy in unaffected females is one in 100 to one in 600, with
one study finding a carrier frequency of one in 250.

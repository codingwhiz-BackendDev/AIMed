Ataxia is a condition marked by impaired coordina-
tion. Friedreich’s ataxia is the most common inherited
ataxia, affecting between 3,000–5,000 people in the Unit-
ed States. FA is an autosomal recessive disease, which
means that two defective gene copies must be inherited to
develop symptoms, one from each parent. A person with
only one defective gene copy will not show signs of FA,
but may pass along the gene to offspring. Couples with
one child affected by FA have a 25% chance in each
pregnancy of conceiving another affected child.

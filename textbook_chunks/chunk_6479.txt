Definition
Cryotherapy is a technique that uses an extremely
cold liquid or instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal
skin cells that require removal. The technique has been in
use since the turn of the century, but modern techniques
have made it widely available to dermatologists and pri-
mary care doctors. The technique is also called
cryosurgery.

images of the heart. These images can show if the heart
wall or chambers are enlarged and if there are any abnor-
malities of the heart valves. Echocardiography can also
evaluate the pumping efficiency of the ventricles.
Cardiac catheterization usually is only used if a
diagnosis cannot be made with other methods. In cardiac
catheterization, a small tube (called a catheter) is inserted
into an artery and passed into the heart. It is used to mea-
sure pressure in the heart and the amount of blood
pumped by the heart. A small tissue sample of the heart
muscle can be removed through the catheter for examina-
tion under a microscope (biopsy). This biopsy can show
the type and amount of damage to the heart muscle.

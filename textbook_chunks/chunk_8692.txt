Chiropractic care has been shown to be effective
for joint subluxation and dislocation, especially in the
spine. Swelling can be addressed using botanical thera-
pies. Bromelain, a pineapple enzyme, and tumeric (Cur-
cuma longa) are the most potent botanical remedies for
this purpose. Acute homeopathic care with arnica (Arni-
ca montana) can reduce the trauma to the body. Liga-
ment and tendon strengthening can be assisted both
botanically and homeopathically.

CAH is a form of adrenal insufficiency in which the
enzyme that produces two important adrenal steroid hor-
mones, cortisol and aldosterone, is deficient. Because
cortisol production is impeded, the adrenal gland instead
overproduces androgens (male steroid hormones).
Females with CAH are born with an enlarged clitoris and
normal internal reproductive tract structures. Males have
normal genitals at birth. CAH causes abnormal growth
for both sexes; patients will be tall as children and short
as adults. Females develop male characteristics, and
males experience premature sexual development.
In its most severe form, called salt-wasting CAH, a
life-threatening adrenal crisis can occur if the disorder
is untreated. Adrenal crisis can cause dehydration,
shock, and death within 14 days of birth. There is also
a mild form of CAH that occurs later in childhood or
young adult life in which patients have partial enzyme
deficiency.
CAH, a genetic disorder, is the most common adren-
al gland disorder in infants and children, occurring in one
in 10,000 total births worldwide. It affects both females
and males. It is also called adrenogenital syndrome.

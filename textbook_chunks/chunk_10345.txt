drainage of the infected fluid and closing up of the space
left in the pleural cavity. If the infection is still in its early
stages, the fluid can be drained by thoracentesis. In sec-
ond-stage empyema, the surgeon will insert a chest tube in
the patientâ€™s rib cage or remove part of a rib (rib resection)
in order to drain the fluid. In third-stage empyema, the sur-
geon may cut or peel away the thick fibrous layer coating
the lung. This procedure is called decortication. When the
fibrous covering is removed, the lung will expand to fill
the space in the chest cavity. The doctor can use video-
assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) techniques to position
the chest tube or to perform a limited decortication. The
VATS technique allows a physician to see within the body
during certain surgical procedures. Empyema of the gall-
bladder is a serious condition that is treated with intra-
venous antibiotics and surgical removal of the gallbladder.

When spinal manipulation is employed, it is generally
done with the hands, although some practitioners may use
an adjusting tool. A classic adjustment involves a high
velocity, low amplitude thrust that produces a usually
painless popping noise, and improves the range of motion
of the joint that was treated. The patient may lie on a spe-
cially designed, padded table that helps the practitioner to
achieve the proper positions for treatment. Some adjust-
ments involve manipulating the entire spine, or large por-
tions of it, as a unit; others are small movements designed
to affect a single joint. Stretching, traction, and slow
manipulation are other techniques that can be employed to
restore structural integrity and relieve nerve interference.

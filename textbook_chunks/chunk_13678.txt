Staphylococcus aureus is found on humans and in
the environment in dust, air, and sewage. The bacteria is
spread primarily by food handlers using poor sanitary
practices. Almost any food can be contaminated, but
salad dressings, milk products, cream pastries, and any
food kept at room temperature, rather than hot or cold are
likely candidates.
It is difficult to estimate the number of cases of food
poisoning from Staphylococcus aureus that occur each
year, because its symptoms are so similar to those caused
by other foodborne bacteria. Many cases are mild and the
victim never sees a doctor.

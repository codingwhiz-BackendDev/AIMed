Oxygen, painkillers, and drugs to control swelling
and seizures are given after the operation. Codeine may
be given to relieve the headache that may occur as a
result of stretching or irritation of the nerves of the scalp
that happens during the craniotomy. Some type of
drainage from the head may be in place, depending on
the reason for the surgery.
Patients are usually out of bed within a day and out
of the hospital within a week. Headache and pain from
the scalp wound can be controlled with medications.
The bandage on the skull should be changed regular-
ly. Sutures closing the scalp will be removed, but soft
wires used to reattach the skull are permanent and
require no further attention. The patient should avoid get-
ting the scalp wet until all the sutures have been
removed. A clean cap or scarf can be worn until the hair
grows back.

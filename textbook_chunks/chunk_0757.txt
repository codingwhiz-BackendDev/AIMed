• Carcinomas are cancers that arise in the epithelium (the
layers of cells covering the body’s surface and lining the
internal organs and various glands). Ninety percent of
human cancers fall into this category. Carcinomas can be
subdivided into two types: adenocarcinomas and squa-
mous cell carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are cancers that
develop in an organ or a gland, while squamous cell car-
cinomas refer to cancers that originate in the skin.
• Melanomas also originate in the skin, usually in the
pigment cells (melanocytes).
• Sarcomas are cancers of the supporting tissues of the
body, such as bone, muscle and blood vessels.
• Cancers of the blood and lymph glands are called
leukemias and lymphomas respectively.
• Gliomas are cancers of the nerve tissue.

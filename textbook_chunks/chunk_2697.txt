Problems can arise in the insertion of the tube if the
membrane lining the chest cavity is thick or if it has
many adhesions. The tube will not drain correctly if the
chest cavity contains blood clots or thick secretions that
are often associated with infections. Excessive bleeding
may occur during the insertion and positioning of the
tube. Infection may result from the procedure. Pain is
also a common complication.

Coronary stenting usually follows balloon angio-
plasty, which requires inserting a balloon catheter into
the femoral artery in the upper thigh. When this catheter
is positioned at the location of the blockage in the coro-
nary artery, it is slowly inflated to widen that artery, and
is then removed. The stent catheter is then threaded into
the artery and the stent is placed around a deflated bal-
loon. When this is correctly positioned in the coronary
artery, the balloon is inflated, expanding the stent against
the walls of the coronary artery. The balloon catheter is
removed, leaving the stent in place to hold the coronary
artery open. A cardiac angiography will follow to insure
that the stent is keeping the artery open.

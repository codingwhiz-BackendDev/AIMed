Diagnosis should be suspected in endemic areas when-
ever a high fever goes on for two to seven days, especially if
accompanied by a bleeding tendency. Symptoms of shock
should suggest the progression of the disease to DSS.
The arbovirus causing dengue fever is one of the few
types of arbovirus that can be isolated from the serum of
the blood. The serum is the fluid in which blood cells are
suspended. Serum can be tested because the phase in
which the virus travels throughout the bloodstream is
longer in dengue fever than in other arboviral infections.
A number of tests are used to look for reactions between
the patient’s serum and laboratory-produced antibodies.
Antibodies are special cells that recognize the markers
(or antigens) present on invading organisms. During
these tests, antibodies are added to a sample of the
patient’s serum. Healthcare workers then look for reac-
tions that would only occur if viral antigens were present
in that serum.

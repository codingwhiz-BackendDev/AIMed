Obstruction of the duodenum occurs in adults and
infants, each for a different set of reasons. In adults, the
usual cause is a peptic ulcer of such antiquity that repeat-
ed cycles of injury and scarring have narrowed the pas-
sageway. Medical treatment of ulcers has progressed to
the point where such obstinate ulcer disease is rarely
seen any more. In infants, the conditions are congeni-
talâ€”either the channel is underdeveloped or the pylorus
is overdeveloped. The first type is called duodenal
hypoplasia and the second is termed hypertrophic
pyloric stenosis. In rare cases, the channel may be miss-
ing altogether, a condition called duodenal atresia. To say
that these anomalies are congenital is not to say their
cause is understood. As with most birth defects, the spe-
cific cause is not known.
Food that cannot exit the stomach in the forward
direction will return whence it came. Vomiting is the
constant symptom of duodenal obstruction. It may be
preceded by indigestion and nausea as the stomach
attempts to squeeze its contents through an ever narrow-
ing outlet.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis appears soon after
birth. The infant will vomit feedings, lose weight, and be
restless and irritable.

Delusional disorder is typically a chronic condition,
but with appropriate treatment, a remission of delusional
symptoms occurs in up to 50% of patients. However,
because of their strong belief in the reality of their delu-
sions and a lack of insight into their condition, individuals
with this disorder may never seek treatment, or may be
resistant to exploring their condition in psychotherapy.

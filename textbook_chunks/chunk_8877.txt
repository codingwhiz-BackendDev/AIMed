Because dizziness may arise from serious conditions,
it is advisable to seek medical treatment. Alternative treat-
ments can often be used alongside conventional medicine
without conflict. Relaxation techniques, such as yoga and
massage therapy that focus on relieving tension, are pop-
ularly recommended methods for reducing stress. Aro-
matherapists recommend a warm bath scented with essen-
tial oils of lavender, geranium, and sandalwood.
Homeopathic therapies can work very effectively
for dizziness, and are especially applicable when no
organic cause can be identified. An osteopath or chiro-
practor may suggest adjustments of the head, jaw, neck,
and lower back to relieve pressure on the inner ear.
Acupuncturists also offer some treatment options for
acute and chronic cases of dizziness. Nutritionists may
be able to offer advice and guidance in choosing dietary
supplements, identifying foods to avoid, and balancing
nutritional needs.

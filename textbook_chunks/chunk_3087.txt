Chiropractic is not an appropriate therapy for dis-
eases that are severely degenerative and may require
medication or surgery. Many conditions of the spine are
amenable to manipulative treatment, but that does not
include fractures. The practitioner should be informed
in advance if the patient is on anticoagulants, or has
osteoporosis or any other condition that may weaken the
bones. There are other circumstances that would con-
traindicate chiropractic care, and these should be detect-
ed in the history or physical exam. In addition to frac-
tures, Down syndrome, some congenital defects, and
some types of cancer are a few of the things that may
preclude spinal manipulation. On rare occasions, a frac-
ture or dislocation may occur. There is also a very slim
possibility of experiencing a stroke as a result of spinal
manipulation, but estimates are that it is no more fre-
quent than 2.5 occurrences per one million treatments.
Be wary of chiropractors who insist on costly x rays
and repeated visits with no end in sight. Extensive use is
not scientifically justifiable, especially in most cases of
lower back pain. There are some circumstances when x
rays are indicated, including acute or possibly severe
injuries such as those that might result from a car accident.

Inadequate or inappropriate nutritional intake can
cause fatigue symptoms. To maintain an adequate energy
supply and promote overall physical well-being, individ-
uals should eat a balanced diet and observe the following
nutritional guidelines:
• Drink plenty of water. Individuals should try to drink 9
to 12 glasses of water a day. Dehydration can reduce
blood volume, which leads to feelings of fatigue.
• Eat iron-rich foods (i.e., liver, raisins, spinach, apri-
cots). Iron enables the blood to transport oxygen
throughout the tissues, organs, and muscles, and dimin-
ished oxygenation of the blood can result in fatigue.
• Avoid high-fat meals and snacks. High fat foods take
longer to digest, reducing blood flow to the brain, heart,
and rest of the body while blood flow is increased to the
stomach.
• Eat unrefined carbohydrates and proteins together for
sustained energy.
• Balance proteins. Limiting protein to 15–20 grams per
meal and two snacks of 15 grams is recommended, but
not getting enough protein adds to fatigue. Pregnant or
breastfeeding women should get more protein.
• Get the recommended daily allowance of B complex
vitamins (specifically, pantothenic acid, folic acid, thi-
amine, and vitamin B12). Deficiencies in these vitamins
can trigger fatigue.
• Get the recommended daily allowance of selenium,
riboflavin, and niacin. These are all essential nutritional
elements in metabolizing food energy.
• Control portions. Individuals should only eat when
they’re hungry, and stop when they’re full. An over-
stuffed stomach can cause short-term fatigue, and indi-
viduals who are overweight are much more likely to
regularly experience fatigue symptoms.

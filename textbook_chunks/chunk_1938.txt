referred to as sentinel headaches. Nausea, vomiting, and
dizziness may accompany sentinel headaches. Unfortu-
nately, these symptoms can be confused with tension
headaches or migraines, and treatment can be delayed
until rupture occurs.
When an aneurysm ruptures, most victims experi-
ence a sudden, extremely severe headache. This
headache is typically described as the worst headache of
the victimâ€™s life. Nausea and vomiting commonly
accompany the headache. The person may experience a
short loss of consciousness or prolonged coma. Other
common signs of a SAH include a stiff neck, fever, and a
sensitivity to light. About 25% of victims experience
neurological problems linked to specific areas of the
brain, swelling of the brain due to fluid accumulation
(hydrocephalus), or seizure.

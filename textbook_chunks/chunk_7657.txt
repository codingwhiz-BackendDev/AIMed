Several drugs are currently being tested for their
ability to slow the progress of AD. These include
acetyl-l-carnitine, which acts on the cellular energy
structures known as mitochondria; propentofylline,
which may aid circulation; milameline, which acts sim-
ilarly to tacrine and donezepil; and ginkgo extract.
Ginkgo extract, derived from the leaves of the Gink-
go biloba tree, interferes with a circulatory protein called
platelet activating factor. It also increases circulation and
oxygenation to the brain. Ginkgo extract has been used
for many years in China and is widely prescribed in
Europe for treatment of circulatory problems. A 1997
study of patients with dementia seemed to show that
gingko extract could improve their symptoms, though the
study was criticized for certain flaws in its method.

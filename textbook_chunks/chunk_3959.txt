A cleft is a birth defect that occurs when the tissues
of the lip and/or palate of the fetus do not fuse very early
in pregnancy. A cleft lip, sometimes referred to as a
harelip, is an opening in the upper lip that can extend into
the base of the nostril. A cleft palate is an opening in the
roof of the mouth.

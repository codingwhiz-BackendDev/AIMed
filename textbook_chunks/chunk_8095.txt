Research continues on ways to prevent diabetes and
to detect those at risk for developing diabetes. While the
onset of Type I diabetes is unpredictable, the risk of
developing Type II diabetes can be reduced by maintain-
ing ideal weight and exercising regularly. The physical
and emotional stress of surgery, illness, pregnancy, and
alcoholism can increase the risks of diabetes, so main-
taining a healthy lifestyle is critical to preventing the
onset of Type II diabetes and preventing further compli-
cations of the disease.

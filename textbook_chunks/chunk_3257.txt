The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ in the
upper right hand corner of the abdomen. It is connected
by a series of ducts (tube-like channels) to the liver, pan-
creas, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine). To
aid in digestion, the liver produces a substance called
bile, which is passed into the gallbladder. The gallblad-
der concentrates this bile, meaning that it reabsorbs some
of the fluid from the bile to make it more potent. After a
meal, bile is squeezed out of the gallbladder by strong
muscular contractions, and passes through a duct into the
duodenum. Due to the chemical makeup of bile, the con-
tents of the duodenum are kept at an optimal pH level for
digestion. The bile also plays an important part in allow-
ing fats within the small intestine to be absorbed.

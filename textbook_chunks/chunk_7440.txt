Fibrillations cause the heart to stop pumping blood,
leading to brain damage and/or cardiac arrest. About
10% of the ability to restart the heart is lost with every
minute that the heart stays in fibrillation. Death can
occur in minutes unless the normal heart rhythm is
restored through defibrillation. Because immediate
defibrillation is crucial to the patient’s survival, the
American Heart Association has called for the integra-
tion of defibrillation into an effective emergency cardiac
care system. The system should include early access,
early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, early defibrilla-
tion, and early advanced cardiac care.
Defibrillators deliver a brief electric shock to the
heart, which enables the heart’s natural pacemaker to
regain control and establish a normal heart rhythm. The
defibrillator is an electronic device with electrocardio-
gram leads and paddles. During defibrillation, the pad-
dles are placed on the patient’s chest, caregivers stand
back, and the electric shock is delivered. The patient’s
pulse and heart rhythm are continually monitored. Med-
ications to treat possible causes of the abnormal heart
rhythm may be administered. Defibrillation continues
until the patient’s condition stabilizes or the procedure is
ordered to be discontinued.
Early defibrillators, about the size and weight of a
car battery, were used primarily in ambulances and hos-
pitals. The American Heart Association now advocates
public access defibrillation; this calls for placing auto-
mated external defibrillators (AEDS) in police vehicles,
airplanes, and at public events, etc. The AEDS are small-
er, lighter, less expensive, and easier to use than the early
defibrillators. They are computerized to provide simple,
verbal instructions to the operator and to make it impos-
sible to deliver a shock to a patient whose heart is not fib-
rillating. The placement of AEDs is likely to expand to
many public locations.

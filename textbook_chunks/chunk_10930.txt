Ileostomy patients must learn to watch their fluid and
salt intake. They are at greater risk of becoming dehydrat-
ed in hot weather, from exercise, or from diarrhea. In
some cases they may need extra bananas or orange juice
in the diet to keep up the level of potassium in the blood.
Patient education includes social concerns as well as
physical self-care. Many ileostomy patients are worried
about the effects of the operation on their close relationships
and employment. If the patient has not seen an ET before
the operation, the aftercare period is a good time to find out
about self-help and support groups. The ET can also evalu-
ate the patientâ€™s emotional reactions to the ostomy.

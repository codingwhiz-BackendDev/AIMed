Delirium is diagnosed through the medical history
and recognition of symptoms during mental status
examination. The most important part of diagnosis is
determining the cause of the delirium. Tests may include
blood and urine analysis for levels of drugs, fluids, elec-
trolytes, and blood gases, and to test for infection; lum-
bar puncture (“spinal tap”) to test for central nervous
system infection; x ray, computed tomography scans
(CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to
look for tumors, hemorrhage, or other brain abnormali-
ty; thyroid tests; electroencephalography (EEG); elec-
trocardiography (ECG); and possibly others as dictated
by the likely cause.

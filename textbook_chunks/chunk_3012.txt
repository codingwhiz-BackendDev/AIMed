All children should have regular well-child check
ups according to the schedule recommended by their
physician or pediatrician. The American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) advises that children be seen for well-
baby check ups at two weeks, two months, four months,
six months, nine months, twelve months, fifteen months,
and eighteen months. Well-child visits are recommended
at ages two, three, four, five, six, eight, ten, and annually
thereafter through age 21.
In addition, an immunization schedule should be fol-
lowed to protect against disease and infection. As of
2001, the AAP and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) recommended that the following childhood
immunizations be administered by age two:

• Hepatitis B. Three doses.
• Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTaP). Four doses.
• H. influenzae type b (Hib). Four doses.
• Inactivated Polio. Three doses.
• Pneumococcal Conjugate. Three doses.
• Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR). One dose.
• Varicella (chickenpox). One dose.
• Hepatitis A. (In certain geographical areas and with
certain high risk groups.)
Some immunizations may cause mild side effects, or
more rarely, serious adverse reactions. However, the ben-
efits of immunization greatly outweigh the incidence of
health problems arising from them.
There are serious chronic diseases and health prob-
lems that are frequently diagnosed in childhood and can-
not be vaccinated against. These include, but are not lim-
ited to, asthma, type I diabetes (juvenile diabetes),
leukemia, hemophilia, and cystic fibrosis.

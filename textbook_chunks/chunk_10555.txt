Women (especially postmenopausal women) should
report any abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge to the
doctor. Controlling obesity, blood pressure, and diabetes
can help to reduce the risk of this disease. Women on
estrogen replacement therapy have a substantially
reduced risk of endometrial cancer if progestins are taken
simultaneously. Long term use of birth control pills has
been shown to reduce the risk of this cancer. Women who
have irregular periods may be prescribed birth control
pills to help prevent endometrial cancer. Women who are
taking tamoxifen and those who carry the hereditary non-
polyposis colorectal cancer gene should be screened reg-
ularly, receiving annual pelvic examinations.

Chromosomes are the units of genetic information
that exist within every cell of the body. Twenty-three dis-
tinctive pairs, or 46 total chromosomes, are located with-
in the nucleus (central structure) of each cell. When a
baby is conceived by the combining of one sperm cell
with one egg cell, the baby receives 23 chromosomes
from each parent, for a total of 46 chromosomes. Some-
times, an accident in the production of a sperm or egg
cell causes that cell to contain 24 chromosomes. This

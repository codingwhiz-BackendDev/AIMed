Decongestants may interact with a variety of other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both
of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may
be greater. Do not take decongestants at the same time as
these drugs:
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) such
as phenzeline (Nardil) or tranylcypromine (Parnate),
used to treat conditions including depression and
Parkinson’s disease. Do not take decongestants at the
same time as a MAO inhibitor or within two weeks of
stopping treatment with an MAO inhibitor unless a
physician approves.
• Other products containing the same or other deconges-
tants.
• Caffeine.
In addition, anyone who takes decongestants should
let the physician know all other medicines he or she is
taking. Among the drugs that may interact with decon-
gestants are:
• tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine (Tofranil)
or desipramine (Norpramin)
• the antidepressant maprotiline (Ludiomil)
• amantadine (Symmetrel)
• amphetamines
• medicine to relieve asthma or other breathing problems
• methylphenidate (Ritalin)
• appetite suppressants
• other medicine for colds, sinus problems, hay fever or
other allergies
• beta-blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin) and propra-
nolol (Inderal)
• digitalis glycosides, used to treat heart conditions
The list above does not include every drug that may
interact with decongestants. Be sure to check with a
physician or pharmacist before combining decongestants
with any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-
counter) medicine.

Fracture repair is required when there is a need for
restoration of the normal position and function of the bro-
ken bone. Throughout the stages of fracture healing, the
bones must be held firmly in the correct position. In the
event the fracture is not properly repaired, malalignment
of the bone may occur, resulting in possible physical dys-
function of the bone or joint of that region of the body.

Surgical debridement (also known as sharp debride-
ment) uses a scalpel, scissors, or other instrument to cut
dead tissue from a wound. It is the quickest and most
efficient method of debridement. It is the preferred
method if there is rapidly developing inflammation of the
body’s connective tissues (cellulitis) or a more general-
ized infection (sepsis) that has entered the bloodstream.
The procedure can be performed at a patient’s bedside. If
the target tissue is deep or close to another organ, howev-
er, or if the patient is experiencing extreme pain, the pro-
cedure may be done in an operating room. Surgical
debridement is generally performed by a physician, but
in some areas of the country an advance practice nurse or
physician assistant may perform the procedure.
The physician will begin by flushing the area with a
saline (salt water) solution, and then will apply a topical
anesthetic gel to the edges of the wound to minimize
pain. Using a forceps to grip the dead tissue, the physi-
cian will cut it away bit by bit with a scalpel or scissors.
Sometimes it is necessary to leave some dead tissue
behind rather than disturb living tissue. The physician
may repeat the process again at another session.

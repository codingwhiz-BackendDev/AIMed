In addition to those findings that may indicate aortic
aneurysms, chest CT studies can show other problems in
the heart and lungs, and distinguish between an aortic
aneurysm and a tumor adjacent to the aorta. The com-
puter will not only show differences between air, water,
tissues, and bone, but will also assign numerical values
to the various densities. Coin-sized lesions in the lungs
may be indicative of tuberculosis or tumors. CT will
help distinguish among the two. Enlarged lymph nodes
in the chest area may indicate Hodgkin’s disease. Spiral
CT is particularly effective at identifying pulmonary
emboli (clots in the lung’s blood vessels).

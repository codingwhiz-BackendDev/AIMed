The increasing availability and lowered cost of CT
scanning has led to its increased use in sinus studies,
either as a replacement for a sinus x ray or as a follow-up
to an abnormal sinus radiograph. The sensitivity of CT
allows for location of areas of sinus infection, particularly
chronic infection. CT scans can show the extent and loca-
tion of tiny fractures to the sinus and nasal bones. Foreign
bodies in the sinus and nasal area are also easily detected
by CT. CT imaging of the sinuses is important in evaluat-
ing trauma or disease of the sphenoid bone (the wedge
shaped bone at the base of the skull). Sinus tumors will
show as shades of gray indicating the difference in their
density from that of normal tissues in the area.

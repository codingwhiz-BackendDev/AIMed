for common variable immunodeficiency aims
at boosting the bodyâ€™s immune response and preventing
or controlling infections. Immune serum, obtained from
donated blood, is given as a source of antibodies to boost
the immune response. Immune serum is obtained from
donated blood. It contains whatever antibodies the
donors had in their blood. Consequently, it may not con-
tain all the antibodies that the patient needs and may lack
antibodies specific for some of the recurring infections
that these patients suffer. Antibiotics are used routinely
at the first sign of an infection to help the patient elimi-
nate infectious microorganisms.

Presently there is no cure for fragile X syndrome.
Management includes such approaches as speech thera-
py, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. The
expertise of psychologists, special education teachers,
and genetic counselors may also be beneficial. Drugs
may be used to treat hyperactivity, seizures, and other
problems. Establishing a regular routine, avoiding over
stimulation, and using calming techniques may also help
in the management of behavioral problems. Children
with a troubled heart valve may need to see a heart spe-
cialist and take medications before surgery or dental pro-
cedures. Children with frequent ear and sinus infections
may need to take medications or have special tubes
placed in their ears to drain excess fluid. Mainstreaming
of children with fragile X syndrome into regular class-
rooms is encouraged because they do well imitating
behavior. Peer tutoring and positive reinforcement are
also encouraged.

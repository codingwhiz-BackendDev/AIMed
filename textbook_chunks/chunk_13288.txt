The treatment for scombroid is usually general.
Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may
shorten the duration of the illness, but the illness will go
away on its own. Some doctors have found that cimeti-
dine (Tagamet) given through a vein may be helpful as
well. In rare, more severe cases, epinephrine (adrenaline)
may be used.

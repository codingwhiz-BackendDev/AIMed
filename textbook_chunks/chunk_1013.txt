Often clinical appearance gives a strong suggestion
about the diagnosis. Generally, a clinician will take a
sample of the vaginal discharge or swab an area of oral
plaque, and then inspect this material under a micro-
scope. Under the microscope, it is possible to see charac-
teristic forms of yeasts at various stages in the lifecycle.
Fungal blood cultures should be taken for patients
suspected of having deep organ candidiasis. Tissue biop-
sy may be needed for a definitive diagnosis.

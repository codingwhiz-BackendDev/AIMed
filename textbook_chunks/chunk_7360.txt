Decongestant nasal sprays and nose drops may
cause a problem called rebound congestion if used
repeatedly over several days. When this happens, the
nose remains stuffy or gets worse with every dose. The
only way to stop the cycle is to stop using the drug. The
stuffiness should then go away within about a week.
Anyone who shows signs of severe rebound congestion
should also contact his or her physician.
Do not use decongestant nasal sprays for more than
three days. Decongestants taken by mouth should not be
used for more than seven days. If the congestion has not
gone away in this time, or if the symptoms are accompa-
nied by fever, call a physician.
Do not use a decongestant nasal spray after the prod-
uctâ€™s expiration date. If the product has become cloudy
or discolored, throw it away and do not use it. Do not
share droppers or spray bottles with anyone else, as this
could spread infection. Do not let droppers and bottle
tips touch countertops or other surfaces.
Some decongestants cause drowsiness. People who
takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or do
anything else that might be dangerous until they have
found out how the drugs affect them.
In general, older people may be more sensitive to the
effects of decongestants and may need to take lower
doses to avoid side effects. People in this age group
should not take long-acting (extended release) forms of
decongestants unless they have previously taken a short-
acting form with no ill effects.
Children may also be more sensitive to the effects of
decongestants. Before giving any decongestant to a
child, check the package label carefully. Some of these
medicines are too strong for use in children. Serious side
effects are possible if they are given large amounts of
these drugs or if they swallow nose drops, nasal spray or
eye drops. If this happens, call a physician or poison cen-
ter immediately.

While traditional x rays image organs in two dimen-
sions, with the possibility that organs in the front of the
body are superimposed over those in the back, CT scans
allow for a more three-dimensional effect. Some have
compared CT images to slices in a loaf of bread. Precise
sections of the body can be located and imaged as cross-
sectional views. The screen before the technologist
shows a computerâ€™s analysis of each section detected by
the x-ray beam. Thus, various densities of tissue can be
easily distinguished.

Cholesterol is a chemical that can both benefit and
harm the body. On the good side, cholesterol plays impor-
tant roles in the structure of cells and in the production of
hormones. But too much cholesterol in the blood can lead
to heart and blood vessel disease. To complicate matters,
not all cholesterol contributes to heart and blood vessel
problems. One type, called high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol, or “good cholesterol,” actually lowers
the risk of these problems. The other type, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or “bad cholesterol,” is the
type that threatens people’s health. The names reflect the
way cholesterol moves through the body. To travel
through the bloodstream, cholesterol must attach itself to
a protein. The combination of a protein and a fatty sub-
stance like cholesterol is called a lipoprotein.
Many factors may contribute to the fact that some
people have higher cholesterol levels than others. A diet
high in certain types of fats is one factor. Medical prob-
lems such as poorly controlled diabetes, an underactive
thyroid gland, an overactive pituitary gland, liver disease
or kidney failure also may cause high cholesterol levels.
And some people have inherited disorders that prevent
their bodies from properly using and eliminating fats.
This allows cholesterol to build up in the blood.

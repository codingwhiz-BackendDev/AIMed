Choking, except during sleep apnea, is a medical
emergency. If choking is due to allergic reaction or infec-
tion, people should summon emergency help or go
immediately to an emergency room. If choking is due to
obstructed airways, the Heimlich maneuver (an emer-
gency procedure in which a person is grasped from
behind in order to forcefully expel the obstruction)
should be performed immediately. In severe cases a tra-
cheotomy (an incision into the trachea through the neck
below the larynx) must be performed.
Patients who suffer airway obstruction during sleep
can be treated with a device similar to an oxygen mask
that creates positive airway pressure and delivers a mix-
ture of oxygen and air.

The spine is made up of 33 bones called vertebrae
separated by spongy rings of elastic material. These
rings, known as disks, are often compared to shock
absorbers because they help to cushion the vertebrae.
Just as importantly, they also make it possible to turn the
head and neck. Over time, these disks slowly become
flattened and less elastic due to everyday wear and tear.
When this process occurs in the disks of the neck, it is
referred to as cervical disk disease. Other general terms
for this process include degenerative disk disease and
intervertebral disk disease.
Cervical disk disease affects everyone to some
degree, often without causing any bothersome symp-
toms. However, this condition can also lead to specific
problems related to nerve functioning. For example, the
outer edge of a disk may tear, allowing the gelatinous
material inside to bulge outward (herniated disk). This
can put pressure on nerves that exit the spine. Two adja-
cent vertebrae may rub together (sometimes resulting in
bone spurs) that can also pinch these nerves. In other
cases, the inner part of the ring may push on the spinal
cord itself, which passes through the disk. Any of these
situations can cause pain and limit movement. While
symptoms primarily affect the neck, they can also occur
in other parts of the body.

Nasal diphtheria produces few symptoms other than
a watery or bloody discharge. On examination, there may
be a small visible membrane in the nasal passages. Nasal
infection rarely causes complications by itself, but it is a
public health problem because it spreads the disease
more rapidly than other forms of diphtheria.

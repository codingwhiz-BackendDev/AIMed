depression. Antianxiety drugs, such as benzodi-
azepines or buspirone may be prescribed for excessive
anxiety that has lasted for at least six months.
Other medications that have been tested or are being
tested for treatment of CFS are:
• Fludrocortisone (Florinef), a synthetic steroid, which is
currently being tested for treatment of people with
CFS. It causes the body to retain salt, thereby increas-
ing blood pressure. It has helped some people with CFS
who have neurally mediated hypotension.
• Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, often prescribed for high
blood pressure. Such drugs, including atenolol (Tenoretic,
Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal), are sometimes pre-
scribed for neurally mediated hypotension.
• Gamma globulin, which contains human antibodies to a
variety of organisms that cause infection. It has been
used experimentally to boost immune function in peo-
ple with CFS.
• Ampligen, a drug which stimulates the immune system
and has antiviral activity. In one small study, ampligen
improved mental function in people with CFS.

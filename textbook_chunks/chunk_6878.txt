After the operation, the patient is given fluid-based
nutrition until the intestines being to function normally
again. Antibiotics are given to prevent infection of the
incision sites. The nature of the organs removed mean
that there will be major lifestyle changes for the person
undergoing the operation. Men will become impotent
because nerves controlling penile erection are cut during
removal of the bladder. In women, infertility is a conse-
quence because the ovaries and uterus are removed.
However, most women who undergo cystectomy are
postmenopausal and past their childbearing years.
Both men and women are fitted with an external bag
that connects to the stoma and collects the urine. The bag
is generally worn around the waist under the clothing. It
takes a period of adjustment to get used to wearing the
bag. Because there is no bladder, urine is excreted as it is
produced, essentially continuously. The stoma must be
treated properly to ensure that it does not become infect-
ed or blocked. Patients must be trained to care for their
stoma. Often there is a period of psychological adjust-
ment to the major change in life style created by the
stoma and bag. Patients should be prepared for this by
discussion with their physician.

CD is diagnosed and treated by a number of social
workers, school counselors, psychiatrists, and psycholo-
gists. Genuine diagnosis may require psychiatric exper-
tise to rule out such conditions as bipolar disorder or
ADHD. A comprehensive evaluation of the child should
ideally include interviews with the child and parents, a
full social and medical history, a cognitive evaluation,
and a psychiatric exam. One or more clinical inventories
or scales may be used to assess the child for conduct dis-
orderâ€”including the Youth Self-Report, the Overt
Aggression Scale (OAS), Behavioral Assessment Sys-
tem for Children (BASC), Child Behavior Checklist
(CBCL), and Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Chil-
dren (DISC). The tests are verbal and/or written and are
administered in both hospital and outpatient settings.

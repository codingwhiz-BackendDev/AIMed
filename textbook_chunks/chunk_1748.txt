way with the organ or tissue in the patient that is failing.
No one knows exactly how cell therapy works, but pro-
ponents claim that the injected cells travel to the similar
organ from which they were taken to revitalize and stim-
ulate that organ’s function and regenerate its cellular
structure. In other words, the cells are not species specif-
ic, but only organ specific. Supporters of cellular treat-
ment believe that embryonic and fetal animal tissue con-
tain active therapeutic agents distinct from vitamins,
minerals, hormones, or enzymes.
Swedish researchers have successfully transplanted
human fetal stem cells into human recipients, and the
procedure is being investigated further as a possible
treatment for repairing brain cells in Parkinson’s
patients. However, because the cells used in these appli-
cations must be harvested from aborted human fetuses,
there is an ethical debate over their use.
Currently, applications of cell therapy in the United
States is still in the research, experimental, and clinical
trial stages. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
has approved the use of one cellular therapy technique
for repairing damaged knee joints. The procedure
involves removing healthy chondrocyte cells, the type
of cell that forms cartilage, from the patient, culturing
them in a laboratory for three to four weeks, and then
transplanting them back into the damaged knee joint of
the patient.

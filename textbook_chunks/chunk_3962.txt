Babies born with cleft lips will have an opening involv-
ing the upper lip. The length of the opening ranges from a
small notch, to a cleft that extends into the base of the nos-
tril. Cleft lips may involve one or both sides of the lip.
Babies born with cleft palates have openings in the
palate, which is the roof of the mouth. The size and posi-
tion of the opening varies. The cleft may be only in the
hard palate, the bony portion of the roof of the mouth,
opening into the floor of the nose. It may be only in the
soft palate, the soft portion of the roof of the mouth. The
cleft palate may involve both the hard and soft palate and
may occur on both sides of the center of the palate.
Babies may have cleft lips with or without cleft
palates. Cleft palates may also occur without cleft lips.
The incidence of cleft lip and palate not associated
with a syndrome is one in 700 newborns. Native Ameri-
cans have an incidence of 3.6 in 1,000 newborns. The inci-
dence among Japanese newborns is 2.1 in 1,000. The inci-
dence among whites is one in 1,000 newborns. African
Americans have an incidence of 0.3 in 1,000 newborns.

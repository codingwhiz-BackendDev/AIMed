Over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin
and acetaminophen (Tylenol) are useful for mild
cramping and menstrual pain. Prescription-strength
and over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)
and naproxen (Naprosyn), are also effective. If pain is
severe, a doctor may prescribe narcotic medications,
although these can be addicting and are rarely used.

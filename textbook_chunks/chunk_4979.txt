Male and female condoms should not be used togeth-
er as there is a risk that one of them may come off. The
male condom should not be snug on the tip of the penis. A
space of about 0.5 in should be left at the end to avoid the
possibility of it breaking during sexual intercourse. The
penis must be withdrawn quickly after ejaculation to pre-
vent the condom from falling off as the penis softens. The
condom should therefore always be removed while the
penis is still erect to prevent the sperm from spilling into
the vagina.

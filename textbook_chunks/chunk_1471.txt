blister at the site of a scratch or bite three to 10 days after
injury. The blister (which sometimes contains pus) often
looks like an insect bite and is usually found on the hands,
arms, or head. Within two weeks of the blister’s appear-

Often the infected person develops a fever or experiences
fatigue or headaches. The symptoms usually disappear
within a month, although the lymph nodes may remain
swollen for several months. Hepatitis, pneumonia, and
other dangerous complications can arise, but the likelihood
of cat-scratch disease posing a serious threat to health is
very small. AIDS patients and other immunocompromised
people face the greatest risk of dangerous complications.
Occasionally, the symptoms of cat-scratch disease take
the form of what is called Parinaud’s oculoglandular syn-
drome. In such cases, a small sore develops on the palpe-
bral conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inner eyelid),
and is often accompanied by conjunctivitis (inflammation
of the membrane) and swollen lymph nodes in front of the
ear. Researchers suspect that the first step in the develop-

Coronary artery disease can be treated many ways.
The choice of treatment depends on the severity of the
disease. Treatments include lifestyle changes and drug
therapy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplas-
ty, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Coronary artery
disease is a chronic disease requiring lifelong care.
Angioplasty or bypass surgery is not a “cure.”
People with less severe coronary artery disease may
gain adequate control through lifestyle changes and drug
therapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that prevent dis-
ease progression—a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, weight
loss if needed, exercise, and not smoking—also help pre-
vent the disease from developing. These lifestyle changes
are discussed in more detail under prevention.
Drugs such as nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium-
channel blockers relieve chest pain and complications of
coronary artery disease, but they cannot clear blocked
arteries. Nitrates (nitroglycerin) improve blood flow to
the heart. Beta-blockers (acebutelol, propranolol) reduce
the amount of oxygen required by the heart during stress.
One type of calcium-channel blocker (verapamil, dilti-
azem hydrochloride) helps keep the arteries open and
reduces blood pressure. Aspirin helps prevent blood
clots from forming on plaques, reducing the likelihood of
a heart attack. Cholesterol-lowering medications are also
indicated in most cases.
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
bypass surgery are procedures that enter the body (inva-
sive procedures) to improve blood flow in the coronary
arteries. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty,

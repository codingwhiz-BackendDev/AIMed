In newborns with congenital heart disease, coarcta-
tion of the aorta develops while the baby is in the womb.
Among the consequences of coarctation of the aorta is
ventricular hypertrophy, an enlarging of the left ventricle
in response to the increased back pressure of the blood
and the demand for more blood by the body. Symptoms
in infants include shortness of breath (dyspnea), diffi-
culty in feeding, and poor weight gain. Older children
usually donâ€™t have symptoms, but may display fatigue,
shortness of breath, or a feeling of lameness in their legs.

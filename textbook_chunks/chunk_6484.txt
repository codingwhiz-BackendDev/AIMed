Cryotherapy is not recommended for certain areas of
the body because of the danger of destruction of tissue or
unacceptable scarring. These areas include: skin that
overlies nerves, the corners of the eyes, the fold of skin
between the nose and lip, the skin surrounding the nos-
trils, and the border between the lips and the rest of the
face. Lesions that are suspected or known to be malig-
nant melanoma should not be treated with cryotherapy,
but should instead be removed surgically. Similarly, basal
cell or squamous cell carcinomas that have reappeared at
the site of a previously treated tumor should also be
removed surgically. If it remains unclear whether a
growth is benign or malignant, a sample of tissue should
be removed for analysis (biopsy) by a pathologist before
any attempts to destroy the lesion with cryotherapy. Care
should be taken in people with diabetes or certain circula-
tion problems when cryotherapy is considered for
growths located on their lower legs, ankles, and feet. In
these patients, healing can be poor and the risk of infec-
tion can be higher than for other patients.

In typical cases, the prognosis is good. The cornea
will heal itself, usually within several days. A very deep
abrasion may lead to scarring. If the abrasion does not
heal properly, a recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) may
result months or even years later. The symptoms are the
same as for an abrasion (e.g., tearing, foreign body sensa-
tion, and blurred vision), but it will keep occurring. Simi-
lar or additional treatment for the RCE may be necessary.

Enteroviruses are so named because they reproduce
initially in the gastrointestinal tract after infection occurs.
Despite, this, they usually do not lead to intestinal symp-
toms; rather it is their spread to organs, such as the nervous
system, heart, skin, and others that causes disease.
Enteroviruses are part of a larger group of viruses known as
Picornaviruses. The word comes from the combination of
“pico” (Spanish, meaning “a little bit”), and RNA (ribonu-
cleic acid, an important component of genetic material).

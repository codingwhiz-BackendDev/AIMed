The first aim of treatment is to keep up nutrition
and avoid dehydration. Medications used to treat diar-
rhea by decreasing intestinal motility, such as Lop-
eramide or Diphenoxylate are also useful, but should
only be used with the advice of a physician. Antibiotics
are of value, if started within three days of onset of
symptoms. They are indicated for those with severe or
persistent symptoms. Either an erythromycin type drug
or one of the fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin)
for five to seven days are the accepted therapies.

Dopamine—Dopamine is a precursor of epineph-
rine and norepinephrine.
Epinephrine—Epinephrine, also called adrenaline,
is a naturally occurring hormone released by the
adrenal glands in response to signals from the sym-
pathetic nervous system. These signals are triggered
by stress, exercise, or by emotions such as fear.
Ganglioneuroma—A ganglioneuroma is a tumor
composed of mature nerve cells.
Neuroblastoma—Neuroblastoma is a tumor of the
adrenal glands or sympathetic nervous system.
Neuroblastomas can range from being relatively
harmless to highly malignant.
Norepinephrine—Norepinephrine is a hormone
secreted by certain nerve endings of the sympa-
thetic nervous system, and by the medulla (center)
of the adrenal glands. Its primary function is to
help maintain a constant blood pressure by stimu-
lating certain blood vessels to constrict when the
blood pressure falls below normal.
Pheochromocytoma—A pheochromocytoma is a
tumor that originates from the adrenal gland’s
chromaffin cells, causing overproduction of cate-
cholamines, powerful hormones that induce high
blood pressure and other symptoms.

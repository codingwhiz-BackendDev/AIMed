The key to maintaining respiratory health in a person
with CF is regular monitoring and early treatment. Lung
function tests are done frequently to track changes in
functional lung volume and respiratory effort. Sputum
samples are analyzed to determine the types of bacteria
present in the lungs. Chest x rays are usually taken at
least once a year. Lung scans, using a radioactive gas,
can show closed off areas not seen on the x ray. Circula-
tion in the lungs may be monitored by injection of a
radioactive substance into the bloodstream.
People with CF live with chronic bacterial coloniza-
tion; that is, their lungs are constantly host to several
species of bacteria. Good general health, especially good
nutrition, can keep the immune system healthy, which
decreases the frequency with which these colonies begin
an infection, or attack on the lung tissue. Exercise is anoth-
er important way to maintain health, and people with CF
are encouraged to maintain a program of regular exercise.
In addition, clearing mucus from the lungs helps to
prevent infection; and mucus control is an important
aspect of CF management. Postural drainage is used to
allow gravity to aid the mucociliary escalator. For this
technique, the person with CF lies on a tilted surface with
head downward, alternately on the stomach, back, or side,
depending on the section of lung to be drained. An assis-
tant thumps the rib cage to help loosen the secretions. A
device called a “flutter” offers another way to loosen
secretions: it consists of a stainless steel ball in a tube.
When a person exhales through it, the ball vibrates, send-
ing vibrations back through the air in the lungs. Some spe-
cial breathing techniques may also help clear the lungs.
Several drugs are available to prevent the airways
from becoming clogged with mucus. Bronchodilators
and theophyllines open up the airways; steroids reduce
inflammation; and mucolytics loosen secretions. Acetyl-

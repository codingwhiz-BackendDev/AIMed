The symptoms of enterobacterial infections are
sometimes classified according to the type of diarrhea
they produce.
WATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC,
EPEC, some types of Salmonella, and some types of
Shigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are
located in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxins
interacting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma-
tion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics.
BLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea
is sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC,
EIEC, some types of Salmonella, some types of Shigella,
and Yersinia. In dysentery, the infection is located in the
colon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation is
present, and antibiotic therapy is usually required.
NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn
infants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fully
understood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial or
viral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The disease
organisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis-
sue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease
of prematurity; 60–80% of cases occur in high-risk
preterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2–5% of cases in
newborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceae
that have been identified in infants with NEC include
Salmonella, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter.

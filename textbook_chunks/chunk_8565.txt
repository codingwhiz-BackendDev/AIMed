Laryngeal diphtheria, which involves the voice box
or larynx, is the form most likely to produce serious
complications. The fever is usually higher in this form of
diphtheria (103–104°F or 39.4–40°C) and the patient is
very weak. Patients may have a severe cough, have diffi-
culty breathing, or lose their voice completely. The
development of a “bull neck” indicates a high level of
exotoxin in the bloodstream. Obstruction of the airway
may result in respiratory compromise and death.

Anyone who has supportive cancer therapy should
let the physician know all other medicines he or she is
taking. Some combinations of drugs may interact, which
may increase or decrease the effects of one or both drugs
or may increase the risk of side effects. Ask the physician
whether the possible interactions can interfere with drug
therapy or cause harmful effects.

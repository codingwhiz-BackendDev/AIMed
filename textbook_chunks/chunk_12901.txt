A dramatic rise in body temperature often includes the following symptoms: A. Loss of fluid results in dehydration. B.The
hypothalamic set-point is increased, raising metabolism. C. Blood vessels in skin dilate. D. Sweat glands produce excess
perspiration. E. Increased pulse rate. F. Increased hypothalmic set-point may introduce chills and shivering to promote heat
production from muscles. G. Skin becomes more heat-sensitive. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
exercise; hormonal imbalances; certain drugs; and dam-
age to the hypothalamus. When an infection occurs,
fever-inducing agents called pyrogens are released, either
by the body’s immune system or by the invading cells
themselves, that trigger the resetting of the thermostat. In
other circumstances, the immune system may overreact
(allergic reactions) or become damaged (autoimmune dis-
eases), causing the uncontrolled release of pyrogens. A
stroke or tumor can damage the hypothalamus, causing
the body’s thermostat to malfunction. Excessive exposure
to the sun or intensely exercising in hot weather can result
in heat stroke, a condition in which the body’s cooling
mechanisms fail. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare, inher-
ited condition in which a person develops a very high
fever when given certain anesthetics or muscle relaxants
in preparation for surgery.
How long a fever lasts and how high it may go
depends on several factors, including its cause, the age of
the patient, and his or her overall health. Most fevers
caused by infections are acute, appearing suddenly and
then dissipating as the immune system defeats the infec-
tious agent. An infectious fever may also rise and fall
throughout the day, reaching its peek in the late after-
noon or early evening. A low-grade fever that lasts for
several weeks is associated with autoimmune diseases
such as lupus or with some cancers, particularly
leukemia and lymphoma.

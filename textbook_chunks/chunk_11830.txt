In newborns, ECMO is used to support or replace an
infant’s undeveloped or failing lungs by providing oxy-
gen and removing carbon dioxide waste products so the
lungs can rest. Infants who need ECMO may include
those with:
• meconium aspiration syndrome (breathing in of a new-
born’s first stool by a fetus or newborn, which can
block air passages and interfere with lung expansion)
• persistent pulmonary hypertension (a disorder in
which the blood pressure in the arteries supplying the
lungs is abnormally high)
• respiratory distress syndrome (a lung disorder usually
of premature infants that causes increasing difficulty in
breathing, leading to a life-threatening deficiency of
oxygen in the blood)
• congenital diaphragmatic hernia (the profusion of part
of the stomach through an opening in the diaphragm).
• pneumonia
• blood poisoning
ECMO is also used to support a child or adult
patient’s damaged, infected, or failing lungs for a few
hours to allow treatment or healing. It is effective for
those patients with severe, but reversible, heart or lung
problems who haven’t responded to treatment with a
ventilator, drugs, or extra oxygen. Adults and children
who need ECMO usually have one of these problems:
• heart failure
• pneumonia
• respiratory failure caused by trauma or severe infec-
tion
The ECMO procedure can help a patient’s lungs and
heart rest and recover, but it will not cure the underlying
disease. Any patient who requires ECMO is seriously ill
and will likely die without the treatment. Because there
is some risk involved, this method is used only when
other means of support have failed.

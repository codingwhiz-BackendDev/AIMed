Biologic therapies primarily function to alter the
patientâ€™s response to cancer. These treatments are mostly
investigations and there are numerous research protocols
studying the effects of biologic treatments. These proto-
cols usually have strict admission criteria that may
exclude potential candidates who can benefit from treat-
ment. These treatments tend to stimulate specific immune
cells or immune chemicals to destroy cancer cells.

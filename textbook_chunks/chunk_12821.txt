FAS is the most common preventable cause of men-
tal retardation. This condition was first recognized and
reported in the medical literature in 1968 in France and in
1973 in the United States. Alcohol is a teratogen, the term
used for any drug, chemical, maternal disease or other
environmental exposure that can cause birth defects or
functional impairment in a developing fetus. Some fea-
tures may be present at birth including low birth weight,
prematurity, and microcephaly. Characteristic facial fea-
tures may be present at birth, or may become more obvi-
ous over time. Signs of brain damage include delays in
development, behavioral abnormalities, and mental retar-
dation, but affected individuals exhibit a wide range of
abilities and disabilities. It has only been since 1991 that
the long-term outcome of FAS has been known. Learning,
behavioral, and emotional problems are common in ado-
lescents and adults with FAS. Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE),
a term no longer favored, is sometimes used to describe
individuals with some, but not all, of the features of FAS.
In 1996, the Institute of Medicine suggested a five-level
system to describe the birth defects, learning and behav-
ioral difficulties in offspring of women who drank alcohol
during pregnancy. This system contains criteria including
confirmation of maternal alcohol exposure, characteristic
facial features, growth problems, learning and behavioral
problems, and birth defects known to be associated with
prenatal alcohol exposure.

Turning from side to side permits lung expansion.
Patients may turn themselves or be turned by a caregiver.
The head of the bed is also elevated to promote drainage
if the patient can tolerate this position. Critically ill
patients and those dependent on mechanical respiration
are turned once every one to two hours around the clock.

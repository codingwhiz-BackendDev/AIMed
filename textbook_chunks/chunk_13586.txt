Eating raw or lightly cooked vegetables every day
will help maintain normal folic acid levels, as will taking
a folic acid supplement containing at least 400 mcg of this
vitamin. Because folic acid deficiency can cause birth
defects, all women of childbearing age who can become
pregnant should consume at least 400 mcg of folic acid
daily; a woman who is pregnant should have regular med-
ical checkups, and take a good prenatal vitamin.

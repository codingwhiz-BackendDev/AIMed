During the detoxification process, patients may expe-
rience side effects of fatigue, malaise, aches and pains,
emotional duress, acne, headaches, allergies, and symp-
toms of colds and flu. Detoxification specialists claim that
these negative side effects are part of the healing process.
These reactions are sometimes called healing crises,
which are caused by temporarily increased levels of tox-
ins in the body due to elimination and cleansing.

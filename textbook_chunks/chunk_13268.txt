Ciguatera diagnosis is based on the typical combina-
tion of symptoms after eating fish. There are no readily
available blood or urine tests to detect the poisoning, but
some researchers have developed a test for the toxin left
on any remaining fish. A person does not have to be in a
tropical area to get ciguatera. Fish can be caught from
one of these distant areas, and can then be shipped and
eaten locally. It is important to report suspected cases to
local public health officials because more cases may
occur from other contaminated fish.

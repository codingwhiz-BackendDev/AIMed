Definition
Electrolytes are positively and negatively charged
molecules, called ions, that are found within cells,
between cells, in the bloodstream, and in other fluids
throughout the body. Electrolytes with a positive charge
include sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium; the
negative ions are chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate.
The concentrations of these ions in the bloodstream
remain fairly constant throughout the day in a healthy
person. Changes in the concentration of one or more of
these ions can occur during various acute and chronic
disease states and can lead to serious consequences.

Chiropractic is from Greek words meaning done by
hand. It is grounded in the principle that the body can
heal itself when the skeletal system is correctly aligned
and the nervous system is functioning properly. To
achieve this, the practitioner uses his or her hands or an
adjusting tool to perform specific manipulations of the
vertebrae. When these bones of the spine are not correct-
ly articulated, resulting in a condition known as subluxa-
tion, the theory is that nerve transmission is disrupted
and causes pain and illness manifested in the back as
well as other areas of the body.
Chiropractic is one of the most popular alternative
therapies currently available. Some would say it now
qualifies as mainstream treatment as opposed to comple-
mentary medicine. Chiropractic treatment is covered by
many insurance plans. It has become well-accepted treat-
ment for acute pain and problems of the spine, including
lower back pain and whiplash. Applications beyond that
scope are not supported by current evidence, although
there are ongoing studies into the usefulness of chiroprac-
tic for such problems as ear infections, dysmenorrhea,
infant colic, migraine headaches, and other conditions.

The dosage of glucocorticoids varies with the drug,
route of administration, condition being treated, and
patient. Consult specific references.
Fludrocortisone, for use in replacement therapy, is
normally dosed at 0.1 mg/day. Some patients require
higher doses. It should normally be administered in con-
junction with cortisone or hydrocortisone.
ACTH, when used for diagnostic purposes, is given
as 10–25 units dissolved in 500 ml of 5% dextrose injec-
tion-infused IV over eight hours. A long-acting form,
which may be used for replacement therapy, is given by
subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection at a
dose of 40 to 80 units every 24–72 hours.

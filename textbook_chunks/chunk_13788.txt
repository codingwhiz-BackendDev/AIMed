Sometimes a foreign object will successfully pass
throught the throat and stomach only to get stuck at the
juncture between the rectum and the anal canal. Items
may also be self-introduced to enhance sexual stimula-
tion and then get stuck. Sudden sharp pain during elimi-
nation may signify that an object is lodged in the rectum.
Other symptoms vary depending upon the size of the
object, its location, how long it has been in place, and
whether or not infection has set in.

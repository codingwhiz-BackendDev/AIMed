The biopsy may cause a small amount of bleeding
(spotting). The woman can resume normal activities right
away. If cramping becomes severe, heavy bleeding
occurs, or the woman develops a high temperature, the
doctor should be notified immediately.
If the test is being done to determine the cause of
infertility, the onset of the menstrual period following the
biopsy should be reported to the doctor. This will allow
the doctor to correctly predict if the endometrium has
been developing at the expected rate.

Fibrin—The last step in the coagulation process.
Fibrin forms strands that add bulk to a forming
blood clot to hold it in place and help “plug” an
injured blood vessel wall.
Platelet—An irregularly shaped cell-like particle
in the blood that is an important part of blood
clotting. Platelets are activated when an injury
causes a blood vessel to break. They change shape
from round to spiny, “sticking” to the broken ves-
sel wall and to each other to begin the clotting
process.
Prothrombin—A type of protein called a glyco-
protein that is converted to thrombin during the
clotting process.
Thrombin—An enzyme that converts fibrinogen
into strands of fibrin.

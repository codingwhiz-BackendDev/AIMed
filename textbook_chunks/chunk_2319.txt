The standard method of diagnosing cervicitis is
through a pelvic examination or a Pap smear. During the
pelvic exam, the physician usually swabs the affected
area, and then sends the tissue sample to a laboratory.
The laboratory tries to identify the specific organism
responsible for causing the cervicitis. A biopsy to take a
sample of tissue from the affected area is sometimes
required in order to rule out cancer. Colposcopy, a pro-
cedure used to look at the cervix under a microscope,
may also be used to rule out cancer.

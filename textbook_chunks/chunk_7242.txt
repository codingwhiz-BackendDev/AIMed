When a terminal illness is diagnosed, a person, fam-
ily, friends, and physicians are all able to prepare for the
impending death. A terminally ill individual goes
through several levels of emotional acceptance while in
the process of dying. First, there is denial and isolation.
This is followed by anger and resentment. Thirdly, a per-
son tries to escape the inevitable. With the realization
that death is eminent, most people suffer from depres-
sion. Lastly, the reality of death is realized and accepted.

No single explanation of factitious disorders covers
all cases. These disorders are variously attributed to
underlying personality disorders; child abuse; the wish
to repeat a satisfying childhood relationship with a doc-
tor; and the desire to deceive or test authority figures.
Also, the wish to assume the role of patient and be cared
for is involved. In many cases, the suffering of a major
personal loss has been implicated.
The following are regarded as indications of a facti-
tious disorder:
• dramatic but inconsistent medical history
• extensive knowledge of medicine and/or hospitals
• negative test results followed by further symptom
development
• symptoms that occur only when the patient is not being
observed
• few visitors
• arguments with hospital staff or similar acting-out
behaviors
• eagerness to undergo operations and other procedures
When patients with factitious disorders are confront-
ed, they usually deny that their symptoms are intentional.
They may become angry and leave the hospital. In many
cases they enter another hospital, which has led to the
nickname “hospital hoboes.”

cation, assisted by the kidneys and intestines. Toxins can
be excreted from the body by the kidneys, bowels, skin,
and lungs. Detoxification treatments become necessary
when the body’s natural detoxification systems become
overwhelmed. This can be caused by long-term effects of
improper diet, stress, overeating, sedentary lifestyles, ill-
ness, and poor health habits in general. When a build up
of toxic substances in the body creates illness, it’s called
toxemia. Some people’s digestive tracts become unable
to digest food properly, due to years of overeating and
diets that are high in fat and processed foods and low in
fiber (the average American diet). When this happens,
food cannot pass through the digestive tract efficiently.
Instead of being digested properly or eliminated from the
bowel, food can literally rot inside the digestive tract and
produce toxic by-products. This state is known as toxic
colon syndrome or intestinal toxemia.
Detoxification therapies try to activate and assist the
body’s own detoxification processes. They also try to
eliminate additional exposure to toxins and strengthen
the body and immune system so that toxic imbalances
won’t occur in the future.

Fifth disease is caused by the human parvovirus B19,
a member of the Parvoviridae family of viruses, that lives
in the nose and throat of the infected person. The virus is
spread through the air by coughing and sneezing. Because
the virus needs a rapidly dividing cell in order to multiply,
it attacks the red blood cells of the body. Once infected, a
person is believed to be immune to reinfection.

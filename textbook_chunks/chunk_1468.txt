Cat-scratch disease (also called cat-scratch fever) is
caused by the Bartonella henselae bacterium, which is
found in cats around the world and is transmitted from
cat to cat by fleas. Researchers have discovered that large
numbers of North American cats carry antibodies for the
disease (meaning that the cats have been infected at some
point in their lives). Some parts of North America have
much higher rates of cat infection than others, however.
Bartonella henselae is uncommon or absent in cold cli-
mates, which fleas have difficulty tolerating, but preva-
lent in warm, humid places such as Memphis, Tennessee,
where antibodies were found in 71% of the cats tested.
The bacterium, which remains in a catâ€™s bloodstream for
several months after infection, seems to be harmless to
most cats, and normally an infected cat will not display
any symptoms. Kittens (cats less than one year old) are
more likely than adult cats to be carrying the infection.
Bartonella henselae can infect people who are
scratched or (more rarely) bitten or licked by a cat. It
cannot be passed from person to person. Although cats
are popular pets found in about 30% of American house-
holds, human infection appears to be rare. One study
estimated that for every 100,000 Americans there are
only 2.5 cases of cat-scratch disease each year (2.5/
100,000). It is also unusual for more than one family
member to become ill; a Florida investigation discovered
multiple cases in only 3.5% of the families studied. Chil-
dren and teenagers appear to be the most likely victims
of cat-scratch disease, although the possibility exists that

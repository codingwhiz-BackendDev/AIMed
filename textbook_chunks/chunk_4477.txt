Cancer of the colon is the disease characterized by
the development of malignant cells in the lining or
epithelium of the first and longest portion of the large
intestine. Malignant cells have lost normal control mech-
anisms governing growth. These cells may invade sur-
rounding local tissue, or they may spread throughout the
body and invade other organ systems.
Synonyms for the colon include the large bowel or
the large intestine. The rectum is the continuation of the
large intestine into the pelvis that terminates in the anus.

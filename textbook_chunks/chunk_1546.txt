The success rate of cataract extraction is very high,
with a good prognosis. A visual acuity of 20/40 or better
may be achieved. If an extracapsular cataract extraction
was performed, a secondary cataract may develop in the
remaining back portion of the capsule. This can occur one
to two years after surgery. YAG capsulotomy is most often
used for this type of cataract. YAG stands for yttrium alu-
minum garnet, the name of the laser used for this proce-
dure. This is a painless outpatient procedure and requires
no incision. The laser beam makes a small opening in the
remaining back part of the capsule, allowing light through.
In a very small percentage (3â€“5%) of surgical cataract
extractions, complications occur. Infections, swelling of
the cornea (edema), bleeding, retinal detachment, and
the onset of glaucoma have been reported. Some problems
may occur one to two days, or even several weeks, after
surgery. Any haziness, redness, decrease in vision, nausea,
or pain should be reported to the surgeon immediately.

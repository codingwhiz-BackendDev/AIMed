The common term for enlarged prostate is BPH,
which stands for benign (non-cancerous) prostatic
hyperplasia or hypertrophy. Hyperplasia means that the
prostate cells are dividing too rapidly, increasing the
total number of cells, and, therefore, the size of the
organ itself. Hypertrophy simply means “enlargement.”
BPH is part of the aging process. The actual changes in
the prostate may start as early as the 30s but take place
very gradually, so that significant enlargement and
symptoms usually do not appear until after age 50. Past
this age the chances of the prostate enlarging and caus-
ing urinary symptoms become progressively greater.
More than 40% of men in their 70s have an enlarged
prostate. Symptoms generally appear between ages
55–75. About 10% of all men eventually will require
treatment for BPH.
BPH has been viewed as a rare condition in African,
Chinese and other Asian peoples for reasons that are not
clear.

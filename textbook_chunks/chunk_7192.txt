Prognosis in healthy people with CMV infection
is excellent. About 0.1% of all newborn babies will
have serious damage from CMV infection occurring
while they were developing in the uterus. About 50%
of all transplant patients will develop severe illnesses
due to reactivation of dormant CMV infection. These
illnesses have a high rate of serious complications
and death.

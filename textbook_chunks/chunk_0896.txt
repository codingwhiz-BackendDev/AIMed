Surgical removal of the tumor must be performed with
care and accuracy. The surgeon must avoid over manipula-
tion of the surgical field. Too much movement within the
area can cause cancer cell displacement into surrounding
tissue. If this occurs and no further treatment is indicated,
the tumor may grow again. The surgeon should also per-
form an assessment concerning tissue removal around the
cancer site. Tissue around the site may not by inspection
seem cancerous, but adjacent structures may have cancer
cells and surrounding tissue removal is usually part of the
operative procedure. Pieces of tumor and the surrounding
area are analyzed microscopically during the operation for
cell type. An adequate resection (removal of tissue) will
reveal normal cells in the specimens analyzed from areas
bordering the cancerous growth. Surgery can also help to
decrease the tumor bulk and, along with other treatment
measures, may provide a cure for certain cancers.
Not only can surgery be curative for some cancers,
but it is an essential diagnostic tool that must be assessed
intraoperatively since microscopic analysis will guide
the surgeon concerning tumor and surrounding tissue
removal. These diagnostic procedures include an aspira-
tion biopsy, which inserts a needle to extract (aspirate)
fluid contained inside a cancerous growth; a needle biop-
sy uses a specialized needle to obtain a core tissue speci-
men; an incision biopsy removes a section from a large
tumor; and an excision biopsy removes the entire tumor.
The surgeon can also take samples of neighboring lymph
nodes. Cancer in surrounding lymph nodes is an impor-
tant avenue for distant spread of cancer to other areas. If
microscopic analysis determines the presence of cancer
cells in lymph nodes then the surgeon may decide to per-
form a more aggressive surgical approach.

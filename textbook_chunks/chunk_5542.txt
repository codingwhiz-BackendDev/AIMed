There are risks associated with some forms of birth
control. Some of the risks of each method are listed
below:
• Birth control pills—The hormone (estrogen) in birth
control pills can increase the risk of heart attack in
women over 40 who smoke.
• IUD—The IUD can increase the risk of serious pelvic
infection. The IUD can also injure the uterus by poking
into or through the uterine wall. Surgery might be need-
ed to fix this.
• Tubal sterilization—“Tying the tubes” is a surgical pro-
cedure and has all the risks of any other surgery, includ-
ing the risks of anesthesia, infection, and bleeding.

Anticoagulants—Drugs that suppress, delay, or
prevent blood clots. Anticoagulants are used to
treat embolisms.
Artery—A blood vessel that carries blood from the
heart to other body tissues. Embolisms obstruct
arteries.
Deep vein thrombosis—A blood clot in the calf’s
deep vein. This frequently leads to pulmonary
embolism if untreated.
Emboli—Clots or other substances that travel
through the blood stream and get stuck in an
artery, blocking circulation.
Thrombolytics—Drugs that dissolve blood clots.
Thrombolytics are used to treat embolisms.
graduated compression stockings and low-dose heparin is
significantly more effective than low-dose heparin alone.
Gradient elastic stockings, also called anti-embolism
stockings, decrease the risk of blood clots by compress-
ing superficial leg veins and forcing blood into the deep
veins. They can be knee-, thigh-, or waist-length. Many
physicians order the use of stockings before surgery and
until there is no longer an elevated risk of developing
blood clots. The risk of deep vein thrombosis after
surgery is reduced 50% with the use of these stockings.
The American Heart Association recommends that the
use of graduated compression stockings be considered
for all high-risk surgical patients.
Intermittent pneumatic compression involves wrap-
ping knee- or thigh-high cuffs around the legs to prevent
blood clots. The cuffs are connected to a pump which
inflates and deflates, mimicking the heart’s normal pump-
ing action and reducing the pooling of blood. Intermittent
pneumatic compression can be used during surgery and
recovery and continues until there is no longer an elevated
risk of developing blood clots. The American Heart Asso-
ciation recommends the use of intermittent pneumatic
compression for patients who cannot take anticoagulants,
for example, spinal cord and brain trauma patients.

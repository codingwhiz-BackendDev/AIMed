If the ectopic pregnancy is discovered in a very early
stage of development, the drug methotrexate may be
given. The best results are obtained when the pregnancy
is less than six weeks old and the tubal mass is no more
than 1.4 in (3.5 cm) in diameter. Methotrexate, which has
been used successfully since 1987, works by inhibiting
the growth of rapidly growing cells. (It is also used to
treat some cancers.) Most side effects are mild and tem-
porary, but the patient must be monitored after treatment.
Usually the medication is injected into the muscle in a
single dose, but may also be given intravenously or
injected directly into the fallopian tube to dissolve the
embryonic tissue. Methotrexate has also been used to
treat ovarian, abdominal, and cervical pregnancies that
are discovered in the early stages.

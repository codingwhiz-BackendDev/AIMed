The medical history relies on questions that allow
the doctor to evaluate the nature and severity of the
problem and its effect on the patientâ€™s life. The doctor
asks, for instance, how long the patient has been suf-
fering from incontinence; how often and under what
circumstances incontinence occurs; whether the patient
has any control over defecation; and whether the
patient has obstacles to defecation in his or her every-
day surroundings, such as a toilet that can be reached
only by climbing a long flight of stairs. For women
who have given birth, a detailed obstetric history is
also necessary.

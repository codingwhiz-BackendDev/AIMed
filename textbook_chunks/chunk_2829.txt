Alternative practitioners seek to lessen the discom-
fort and fever caused by chickenpox. Like other practi-
tioners, they suggest cool or lukewarm baths. Rolled oats
(Avena sativa) in the bath water help relieve itching.
(Place oats in a sock, run the bath, turn the sock to
release the milky anti-itch properties.) Other recom-
mended remedies for itching include applying aloe vera,
witch hazel, or herbal preparations of rosemary (Rosmar-
inus officinalis) and calendula (Calendual officinalis) to
the blisters. Homeopathic remedies are selected on a case
by case basis. Some common remedy choices are tartar
emetic (antimonium tartaricum), windflower (pulsatilla),
poison ivy (Rhus toxicodendron), and sulphur.

The amount of risk depends on the hospital, the skill
of the surgeon, and the severity of underlying disease.
Patients who have just had an acute stroke are at greatest
risk. During carotid artery surgery, blood flow is inter-
rupted through the artery, so that paralysis and other
stroke symptoms may occur. These may resolve after
surgery, or may result in permanent stroke. Paralysis is
usually one-sided; other stroke symptoms may include
loss of half the field of vision, loss of sensation, double
vision, speech problems, and personality changes. Risks
of endarterectomy to treat either carotid artery or periph-
eral vascular disease include:
• reactions to anesthesia
• bleeding
• infection
• blood clots

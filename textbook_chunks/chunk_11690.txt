Strengthening exercise increases muscle strength
and mass, bone strength, and the body’s metabolism. It
can help attain and maintain proper weight and improve
body image and self-esteem. A certain level of muscle
strength is needed to do daily activities, such as walking,
running and climbing stairs. Strengthening exercises
increase this muscle strength by putting more strain on a
muscle than it is normally accustomed to receiving. This
increased load stimulates the growth of proteins inside
each muscle cell that allow the muscle as a whole to con-
tract. There is evidence indicating that strength training
may be better than aerobic exercise alone for improving
self-esteem and body image. Weight training allows one
immediate feedback, through observation of progress in
muscle growth and improved muscle tone. Strengthening
exercise can take the form of isometric, isotonic and iso-
kinetic strengthening.
ISOMETRIC EXERCISE. During isometric exercises,
muscles contract. However, there is no motion in the
affected joints. The muscle fibers maintain a constant
length throughout the entire contraction. The exercises
are usually performed against an immovable surface or
object such as pressing one’s hand against a wall. The
muscles of the arm are contracting but the wall is not
reacting or moving as a result of the physical effort. Iso-
metric training is effective for developing total strength
of a particular muscle or group of muscles. It is often
used for rehabilitation since the exact area of muscle
weakness can be isolated and strengthening can be
administered at the proper joint angle. This kind of train-
ing can provide a relatively quick and convenient method

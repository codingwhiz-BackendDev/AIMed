Empyema is a condition in which pus and fluid from
infected tissue collects in a body cavity. The name comes
from the Greek word empyein meaning pus-producing
(suppurate). Empyema is most often used to refer to col-
lections of pus in the space around the lungs (pleural cav-
ity), but sometimes refers to similar collections in the
gall bladder or the pelvic cavity. Empyema in the pleural
cavity is sometimes called empyema thoracis, or empye-
ma of the chest, to distinguish it from empyema else-
where in the body.

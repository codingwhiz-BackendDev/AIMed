In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg implants in a
location outside the uterus and attempts to develop at that
site.The most common site of an ectopic pregnancy is the
fallopian tube, but it can occur in the ovary, the abdomen,
and the cervical wall. More than 95% of all ectopic pregnan-
cies occur in the fallopian tube. (Illustration by Electronic Illus-

will perform a pelvic examination to locate the source of
pain and to detect a mass in the abdomen.
Several laboratory tests of the patient’s blood pro-
vide information for diagnosis. Measurement of the
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level in the
patient’s blood serum is the most useful laboratory test in
the early stages. In a normal pregnancy, the level of this
hormone doubles about every two days during the first
10 weeks. In an ectopic pregnancy, the rate of the
increase is much slower and the low hCG for the stage of
the pregnancy is a strong indication that the pregnancy is
abnormal. (It could also represent a miscarriage in
progress.) The level is usually tested several times over a
period of days to determine whether or not it is increas-
ing at a normal rate.
Progesterone levels in the blood are also measured.
Lower than expected levels can indicate that the pregnan-
cy is not normal.
An ultrasound examination may provide information
about whether or not the pregnancy is ectopic. A device

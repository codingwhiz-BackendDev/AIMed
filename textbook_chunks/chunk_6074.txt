The causes of costochondritis are not well-under-
stood and may be difficult to establish. The most likely
causes include injury, repetitive minor trauma, and
unusual excessive physical activity.
The primary symptom of costochondritis is severe
chest wall pain, which may vary in intensity. The pain
becomes worse with trunk movement, deep breathing,
and/or exertion, and better with decreased movement, quiet
breathing, or changing of position. It is usually localized but
may radiate extensively from the chest area. The pain has
been described as sharp, nagging, aching, or pressure-like.

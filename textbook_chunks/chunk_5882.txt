Major risk factors significantly increase the chance
of developing coronary artery disease. Those that cannot
be changed are:
• Heredity—People whose parents have coronary artery
disease are more likely to develop it. African-Ameri-
cans are also at increased risk because they experience
a higher rate of severe hypertension than whites do.
• Sex—Men are more likely to have heart attacks than
women are and to have them at a younger age. Over age
60, however, women have coronary artery disease at a
rate equal to that of men.
• Age—Men who are 45 years of age and older and
women who are 55 years of age and older are more
likely to have coronary artery disease. Occasionally,
coronary disease may strike a person in the 30s. Older
people (those over 65) are more likely to die of a heart
attack. Older women are twice as likely as older men to
die within a few weeks of a heart attack.

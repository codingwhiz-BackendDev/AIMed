Drug interactions can be difficult to detect. In some
cases, adverse reactions may closely resemble the symp-
toms of the disease or condition the medication was pre-
scribed to treat. Patients who take a number of medications
or self-treat with over-the-counter drugs and/or herbal
remedies may not be able to determine which drug actually
triggered the interaction. A 2001 study by University of
Florida researchers found that less than half of the women
participating disclosed their use of herbal therapies to their
healthcare providers. In cases where a serious drug or herb
interaction occurs, withholding this information can delay
diagnosis and put the patient at increased risk.

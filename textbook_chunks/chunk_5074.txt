Many cases of congenital amputation are not diag-
nosed until the baby is born. Ultrasound examinations
may reveal the absence of a limb in some developing
fetuses, but routine ultrasounds may not pick up signs of
more subtle defects. However, if a doctor suspects that
the fetus is at risk for developing a limb deficiency (for
example, if the mother has been exposed to radiation), a
more detailed ultrasound examination may be performed.

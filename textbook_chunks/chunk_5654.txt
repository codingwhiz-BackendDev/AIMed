ease (COPD). In fact, about 85% of patients diagnosed
with cor pulmonale have COPD. Chronic bronchitis and
emphysema are types of COPD. High blood pressure in
the blood vessels of the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)
causes the enlargement of the right ventricle. In addition
to COPD, cor pulmonale may also be caused by lung dis-
eases, such as cystic fibrosis, pulmonary embolism, and
pneumoconiosis. Loss of lung tissue after lung surgery
or certain chest-wall disturbances can produce cor pul-
monale, as can neuromuscular diseases, such as muscu-
lar dystrophy. A large pulmonary thromboembolism
(blood clot) may lead to acute cor pulmonale.

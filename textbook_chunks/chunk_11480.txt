Physicians who suspect esophageal atresia after
being presented with the above symptoms diagnose the
condition using x-ray imaging or by passing a catheter
through the nose and into the esophagus. Esophageal
atresia is indicated if the catheter hits an obstruction 4–5
in (10–13 cm) from the nostrils.

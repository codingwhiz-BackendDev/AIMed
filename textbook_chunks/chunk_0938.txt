Pain is one of the common symptoms associated with
cancer. Approximately 75% of terminal cancer patients
have pain. Pain is a subjective symptom and thus it cannot
be measured using technological approaches. Pain can be
assessed using numeric scales (from one to 10, one is rated
as no pain while 10 is severe) or rating specific facial
expressions associated with various levels of pain. The
majority of cancer patients experience pain as a result of
tumor mass that compresses neighboring nerves, bone, or
soft tissues, or from direct nerve injury (neuropathic pain).
Pain can occur from affected nerves in the ribs, muscles,
and internal structures such as the abdomen (cramping
type pain associated with obstruction). Many patients also
experience various types of pain as a direct result of fol-
low-up tests, treatments (surgery, radiation, and chemo-
therapy) and diagnostic procedures (i.e., biopsy).

DCS sufferers who undergo chamber treatment within
a few hours of symptom onset usually enjoy a full recovery.
If treatment is delayed the consequences are less pre-
dictable, although many people have been helped even after
several days have passed. A 1992 DAN report on diving
accidents indicated that full recovery following chamber
treatment was immediate for about 50% of divers. Some
people, however, suffer numbness, tingling, or other symp-
toms that last weeks, months, or even a lifetime. In the Oki-
nawa study, six of the 94 patients experienced “long-last-
ing” symptoms even after repeated chamber treatments.

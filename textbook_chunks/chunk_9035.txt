Emergency medical treatment may include:
• Assessment of the patient’s airway and breathing to
making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is
not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through
the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient
breath. This procedure is called intubation.
• Assessment of the patient’s heart rate, blood pressure,
body temperature, and other physical signs that might
indicate the effects of the drug.
• Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for
the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any
other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

In humans, fluke infections can be classified accord-
ing to those diseases caused by liver flukes and those
caused by lung flukes. Diseases caused by liver flukes
include fascioliasis, opisthorchiasis, and clonorchiasis.
Cases of liver fluke infection have been reported in Europe
and the United States, as well as the Middle East, China,
Japan, and Africa. Diseases caused by lung flukes include
paragonimiasis. Paragonimiasis is a common infection in
the Far East, Southeast Asia, Africa, Central and South
America, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands. It is estimated
that between 40 million and 100 million people worldwide
suffer from either liver or lung fluke infections.
In their adult stage, liver and lung flukes are sym-
metrical in shape, ranging between 1/4â€“1 in in length,
and look somewhat like long, plump leaves or blades of
grass. They enter through the mouth and can infect any
person at any age.

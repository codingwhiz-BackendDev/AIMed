The esophagus is a muscular tube that propels food
into the stomach. A defect in the wall of the esophagus
may allow the lining to herniate, creating a space where
food can be caught. Pouches can appear anywhere
between the throat and the stomach. They occur primari-
ly in men and usually later in life.
Different names for the condition apply to different
locations along the esophagus:
• Zenker’s diverticula are pharyngeal pouches, or ones
that occur in the upper neck area at the top of the esoph-
agus.
• Traction diverticula are a type of mid-esophageal
pouch.
• Epiphrenic diverticula occur at the bottom of the esoph-
agus near where it enters the stomach.

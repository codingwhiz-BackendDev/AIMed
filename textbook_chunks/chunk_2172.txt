Most cases of cervical cancers are preventable,
since they start with easily detectable precancerous
changes. Therefore, the best prevention for cervical can-
cer is a regular Pap test. When precancerous changes are
detected, appropriate treatment can prevent the develop-
ment of invasive cancer. The ACS recommends that
women have annual Pap tests beginning when they first
start having sex or at age 18. Women who are past
menopause or some women with hysterectomies contin-
ue to require Pap tests.
The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early
Detection Program provides free or low-cost Pap tests
and treatment for women without health insurance, for
older women, and for members of racial and ethnic
minorities. The program is administered through individ-
ual states, under the direction of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.

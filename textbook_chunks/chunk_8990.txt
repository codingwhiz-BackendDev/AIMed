Drugs can interact with other drugs, foods, and bev-
erages. Interactions can lessen or magnify the desired
therapeutic effect of a drug, or may cause unwanted or
unexpected side effects. There are thousands of possible
drug-to-drug and drug-to-food interactions, and many
medications and supplements are contraindicated (not
recommended) under certain conditions or in patients
with specific diseases and disorders. This is why it is
imperative that patients always keep their physician fully
informed about all drugs and dietary supplements
(including herbal remedies) they are taking.

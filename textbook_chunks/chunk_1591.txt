Pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the chromaffin
cells of the adrenal gland) and tumors of the nervous sys-
tem (neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and gan-
glioneuromas) that affect hormone production can cause
excessive levels of different catecholamines to be secret-
ed. This results in constant or intermittent high blood
pressure (hypertension). Episodes of high blood pres-
sure may be accompanied by symptoms such as
headache, sweating, palpitations, and anxiety. The cat-
echolamines test can be ordered, then, to determine if
high blood pressure and other symptoms are related to
improper hormone secretion and to identify the type of
tumor causing elevated catecholamine levels.

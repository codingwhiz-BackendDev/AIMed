Electrolyte concentrations are similar whether mea-
sured in serum or plasma. Values can be expressed in
terms of weight per unit volume (mg/deciliter; mg/dL) or
in the number of molecules in a volume, or molarity
(moles or millimoles/liter; M or mM). The range of nor-
mal values sometimes varies slightly between different
age groups, for males and females, and between different
analytical laboratories.
The normal level of serum sodium is in the range of
136–145 mM. The normal levels of serum potassium are
3.5–5.0 mM. Note that sodium occurs at a much higher
concentration than potassium. The normal concentration
of total serum calcium (bound calcium plus free calcium)
is in the range of 8.8–10.4 mg/dL. About 40% of the total
calcium in the plasma is loosely bound to proteins; this

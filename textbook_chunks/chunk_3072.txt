An initial chiropractic exam will most often include a
history and a physical. The patient should be asked about
what the current complaint is, whether there are chronic
health problems, family history of disease, dietary habits,
medical care received, and any medications currently
being taken. Further, the current complaint should be
described in terms of how long it has been a problem,
how it has progressed, and whether it is the result of an
injury or occurred spontaneously. Details of how an
injury occurred should be given. The physical exam
should evaluate by observation and palpation whether the
painful area has evidence of inflammation or poor align-
ment. Range of motion may also be assessed. In the spine,
either hypomobility (fixation) or hypermobility may be a
problem. Laboratory analysis is helpful in some cases to
rule out serious infection or other health issues that may
require referral for another type of treatment. Many prac-
titioners also insist on x rays during the initial evaluation

Anyone who is taking digitalis drugs should be sure
to tell the health care professional in charge before hav-
ing any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emer-
gency treatment. Physicians may advise people taking
digitalis drugs to wear or carry medical identification
indicating that they are taking this medicine.
Patients need to be very careful not to accidentally
take this medicine in place of another medicine that
looks similar. Patients who are taking other medicines
that look like their digitalis medicine should ask their
pharmacists for suggestions on how to avoid mix-ups.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to digitalis
drugs in the past should let his or her physician know
before taking the drugs again. The physician should also
be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives,
or other substances.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who
may become pregnant should check with their physicians
before using digitalis drugs.
Older people may be especially sensitive to the
effects of digitalis drugs, which may increase the chance
of overdose.

following medical problems should make sure their
physicians are aware of their conditions:

Normally after the material has been removed
from the chest cavity and the situation is resolved, the
chest drainage tube is removed. In cases where the rea-
son for the tube was air in the pleural cavity, the tube is
clamped and left in place several hours before it is
removed to make sure no more air is leaking into the
space. If the patient is on mechanical ventilation, the
tube is often left in place until a respirator is no longer
necessary. Chest drainage therapy is usually done in
conjunction with treating the underlying cause of the
fluid build-up.
The fluid that has been drained is examined for bac-
terial growth, cancer cells, pus, and bloodâ€”to determine
the underlying cause of the condition and appropriate
treatment.

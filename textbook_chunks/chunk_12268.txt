Extreme pain, fear, or stress may bring on fainting.
This type of fainting is caused by overstimulation of the
vagus nerve, a nerve connected to the brain that helps con-
trol breathing and circulation. In addition, a person who
stands still or erect for too long may faint. This type of
fainting occurs because blood pools in the leg veins,
reducing the amount that is available for the heart to pump
to the brain. This type of fainting is quite common in older
people or those taking drugs to treat high blood pressure.
When an older person feels faint upon turning the
head or looking upward suddenly, the cause could be
osteoarthritis of the neck bones. Osteoarthritis damages
the cartilage between the neck bones and causes pressure
on blood vessels leading to the brain.
Fainting can be a symptom of a disease such as
Stokes-Adams syndrome, a condition in which blood
flow to the brain is temporarily reduced because of an
irregular heartbeat. Some people may experience fainting
associated with weakness in the limbs or a temporary
problem in speaking caused by obstructed blood flow in
vessels passing through the neck to the brain. Pregnant
women frequently feel faint. Fainting may also occur as a
result of low blood sugar. Low blood sugar can occur if a
person skips a meal or has diabetes.

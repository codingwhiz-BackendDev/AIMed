According to the Divers Alert Network (DAN), a
worldwide organization devoted to safe-diving research
and promotion, less than 1% of divers fall victim to DCS
or the rarer bubble problem called gas embolism, air
embolism, or arterial gas embolism (AGE). A study of the
United States military community in Okinawa, where tens
of thousands of sport and military dives are made each
year, identified 84 DCS and 10 AGE cases in 1989â€“95,
including nine deaths. This translated into estimates of one
case in every 7,400 dives and one death in every 76,900
dives. DCS symptoms can be quite mild, however, and
many cases certainly go unnoticed by divers.
At times the terminology adopted by writers on
DCS can be confusing. Some substitute the term
decompression illness (DCI) for DCS. Others treat DCI
as a label encompassing both DCS and AGE. An older
term for DCS is caisson disease, coined in the nine-
teenth century when it was discovered that bridge con-
struction crews working at the bottom of lakes and
rivers in large pressurized enclosures (caissons) were
experiencing joint pain (a typical DCS symptom) on
returning to the surface.

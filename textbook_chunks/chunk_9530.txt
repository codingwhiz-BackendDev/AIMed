After ingestion, the eggs develop into embryos with-
in the intestines and then travel to the liver and lungs
through major blood vessels. The embryos then begin to
form cysts within the liver and lungs, causing damage as
they enlarge over a period of five to 20 years. Cysts may
become over 8 in (20.3 cm)or more in size and contain a
huge amount of highly allergenic fluid. Studies show that
while the liver is most often targeted, lungs, brain, heart,
and bone can also be affected.
The major symptoms are due to compression dam-
age, blockage of vessels and ducts (such as the bile
ducts), and leakage of fluid from cysts. The following
symptoms are frequent.

Difficulty swallowing, bad breath, or food reappear-
ing in the back of the mouth are among the signs physi-
cians look for when diagnosing this condition. Sometimes
the patient may also experience pain in the chest resem-
bling a heart attack. A series of x rays taken while swal-
lowing a contrast agent usually demonstrates the divertic-
ulum clearly. An esophagoscopy may also be needed to
gather more detail. Manometry, measuring pressures
inside the esophagus using a balloon that is passed down
it, may help determine the cause of the diverticula.

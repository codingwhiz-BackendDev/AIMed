Several different medications have given good
results in small trials. The antimigraine drugs
amitriptyline and cyproheptadine performed well for one
study group. Propanolol is sometimes effective, and ery-
thromycin helped several patients in one study, not
because it is an antibiotic but because it irritates the
stomach and encourages it to move its contents forward
instead of in reverse.

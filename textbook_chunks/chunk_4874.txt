Pregnant women or those who could possibly be
pregnant should not have a CT scan unless the diagnostic
benefits outweigh the risks. Pregnant patients should par-
ticularly avoid full body or abdominal scans. If the exam
is necessary for obstetrics purposes, technologists are
instructed not to repeat films if there are errors. Pregnant
patients receiving CT or any x-ray exam away from the
abdominal area may be protected by a lead apron; most
radiation, known as scatter, travels through the body and
is not blocked by the apron.
Contrast agents are often used in CT exams and the
use of these agents should be discussed with the medical
professional prior to the procedure. Patients should be
asked to sign a consent form concerning the administra-
tion of contrast. One of the common contrast agents,
iodine, can cause allergic reactions. Patients who are
known to be allergic to iodine (or shellfish) should
inform the physician prior to the CT scan.

Antitussives are drugs that suppress a cough. Nar-
cotics—primarily codeine—are used as antitussives and
work by depressing the cough center in the brain. How-
ever, they can cause such side effects as drowsiness, nau-
sea, and constipation. Dextromethorphan, the primary
ingredient in many over-the-counter cough remedies,
also depresses the brain’s cough center, but without the
side effects associated with narcotics. Demulcents
relieve coughing by coating irritated passageways.

Small particles like sand may be removable without
medical help, but if the object is not visible or cannot be
retrieved, prompt emergency treatment is necessary.
Trauma to the eyes can lead to loss of vision and should
never be ignored. Before attempting any treatment, the
person should move to a well-lighted area where the
object can be more easily spotted. Hands should be
washed and only clean, preferably sterile, materials
should make contact with the eyes. If the particle is
small, it can be dislodged by blinking or pulling the
upper lid over the lower lid and flushing out the speck. A
clean cloth can also be used to pick out the offending
particle. Afterwards, the eye should be rinsed with clean,
lukewarm water or an opthalmic wash.
If the foreign object cannot be removed at home, the
eye should be lightly covered with sterile gauze to dis-
courage rubbing. A physician will use a strong light and
possibly special eyedrops to locate the object. Surgical
tweezers can effectively remove many objects. An
antibiotic sterile ointment and a patch may be pre-
scribed. If the foreign body has penetrated the deeper
layers of the eye, an opthalmic surgeon will be consulted
for emergency treatment.

Amnesia
Amnesia in a dissociative disorder is marked by
gaps in a patient’s memory for long periods of time or for
traumatic events. Doctors can distinguish this type of
amnesia from loss of memory caused by head injuries or
drug intoxication, because the amnesia is “spotty” and
related to highly charged events and feelings.

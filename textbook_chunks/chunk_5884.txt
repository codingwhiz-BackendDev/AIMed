• Smoking—Smoking increases both the chance of
developing coronary artery disease and the chance of
dying from it. Smokers are two to four times more like-
ly than are non-smokers to die of sudden heart attack.
They are more than twice as likely as non-smokers to
have a heart attack. They are also more likely to die
within an hour of a heart attack. Second hand smoke
may also increase risk.
• High cholesterol—Dietary sources of cholesterol are
meat, eggs, and other animal products. The body also
produces it. Age, sex, heredity, and diet affect one’s
blood cholesterol. Total blood cholesterol is considered
high at levels above 240 mg/dL and borderline at 200-
239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein
(LDL cholesterol) begin at 130–159 mg/dL, depending
on other risk factors. Risk of developing coronary
artery disease increases steadily as blood cholesterol
levels increase above 160 mg/dL. When a person has
other risk factors, the risk multiplies.
• High blood pressure—High blood pressure makes the
heart work harder and weakens it over time. It increases
the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and con-
gestive heart failure. A blood pressure of 140 over 90
or above is considered high. As the numbers rise, high
blood pressure goes from Stage 1 (mild) to Stage 4
(very severe). In combination with obesity, smoking,

It is important to note that a true-positive finding
only signifies the presence of blood—it is not an indica-
tion of cancer. The National Cancer Institute states that,
in its experience, less than 10% of all positive results
were caused by cancer. The FOBT is positive in 1–5% of
the unscreened population and 2–10% of those are found
to have cancer. The physician will want to follow up on a
positive result with further tests, as indicated by other
factors in the patient’s history or condition.

Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common and
extremely infectious childhood disease that also affects
adults on occasion. It produces an itchy, blistery rash that
typically lasts about a week and is sometimes accompa-
nied by a fever or other symptoms. A single attack of
chickenpox almost always confers lifelong immunity
against the disease. Because the symptoms of chicken-
pox are easily recognized and in most cases merely
unpleasant rather than dangerous, treatment can almost
always be carried out at home. Severe complications can
develop, however, and professional medical attention is
essential in some circumstances.

There is currently no cure for diabetes; the condi-
tion, however, can be managed so that patients can live a
relatively normal life. Treatment of diabetes focuses on
two goals: keeping blood glucose within normal range
and preventing the development of long-term complica-
tions. Careful monitoring of diet, exercise, and blood
glucose levels are as important as the use of insulin or
oral medications in preventing complications of diabetes.

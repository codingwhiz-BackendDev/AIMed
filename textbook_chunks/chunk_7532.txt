The most accurate TB test is the Mantoux test, in
which a small amount of TB antigen is injected into
the skin. The area is examined 48–72 hours after the
injection.
In the patch test, 20–30 adhesive patches are usually
placed on the upper back. The patches are kept in place
and the area is kept dry for 48 hours. The patches are
then removed, and the skin is examined 24 hours after-
ward, and possibly again a day or more following that.
Patch testing is usually performed following a patient
complaint of skin irritation from an unknown substance.
Testing may suggest several candidates; identifying the
right one requires careful review of the patient’s possi-
ble exposure.
The test of overall T cell responsiveness is per-
formed with several injections. Each area injected is cir-
cled and marked. Results are read 48 hours after the
injection.

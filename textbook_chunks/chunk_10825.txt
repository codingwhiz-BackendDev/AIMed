Enterobacterial infections can be produced by bacte-
ria that normally live in the human digestive tract without
causing serious disease, or by bacteria that enter from the
outside. In many cases these infections are nosocomial,
which means that they can be acquired in the hospital.
Klebsiella and Proteus sometimes cause pneumonia, ear
and sinus infections, and urinary tract infections. Enter-
obacter and Serratia often cause bacterial infection of
the blood (bacteremia), particularly in patients with
weakened immune systems.
Diarrhea caused by enterobacteria is a common
problem in the United States. It is estimated that each
person in the general population has an average of 1.5
episodes of diarrhea each year, with higher rates in chil-
dren, institutionalized people, and Native Americans.
This type of enterobacterial infection can range from a
minor nuisance to a life-threatening disorder, especially
in infants, elderly persons, AIDS patients, and malnour-
ished people. Enterobacterial infections are one of the
two leading killers of children in developing countries.

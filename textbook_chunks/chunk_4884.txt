made. A technologist watches the procedure from a win-
dow and views the images on a computer screen.
It is essential that the patient lie very still during the
procedure to prevent motion blurring. In some studies,
such as chest CTs, the patient will be asked to hold his or
her breath during image capture.
Following the procedure, films of the images are
usually printed for the radiologist and referring physician
to review. A radiologist can also interpret CT exams on a
special computer screen. The procedure time will vary in
length depending on the area being imaged. Average
study times are from 30 to 60 minutes. Some patients
may be concerned about claustrophobia, but the width of
the “doughnut” portion of the scanner is such that many
patients can be reassured of openness.

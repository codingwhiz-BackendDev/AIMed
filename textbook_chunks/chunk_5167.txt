Congenital hip dysplasia is a disorder in children
that is either present at birth or shortly thereafter. During
gestation, the infantâ€™s hip should be developing with the
head of the thigh bone (femur) sitting perfectly centered
in its shallow socket (acetabulum). The acetabulum
should cover the head of the femur as if it were a ball sit-
ting inside of a cup. In the event of congenital hip dyspla-
sia, the development of the acetabulum in an infant
allows the femoral head to ride upward out of the joint
socket, especially when weight bearing begins.

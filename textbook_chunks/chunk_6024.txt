Addison’s disease—A rare disorder in which symp-
toms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocortisone
(cortisol) and aldosterone, two corticosteroid hor-
mones normally produced by a part of the adrenal
glands called the adrenal cortex. Symptoms include
weakness, tiredness, vague abdominal pain, weight
loss, skin pigmentation and low blood pressure.
Adrenal glands—A pair of endocrine glands (glands
that secrete hormones directly into the blood-
stream) that are located on top of the kidneys.
Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)—Also
called corticotropin, this hormone is produced by
the pituitary gland to stimulate the adrenal cortex
to release various corticosteroid hormones.
Cushing’s syndrome—A hormonal disorder caused
by an abnormally high level of corticosteroid hor-
mones that are produced by the adrenal glands. Cor-
ticosteroid hormones control the body’s use of nutri-
ents and the excretion of salts and water in the urine.

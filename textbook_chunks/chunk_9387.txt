An otoscope is used to look into the ear canal to see
the ear drum. Redness or fluid in the eardrum can indi-
cate an ear infection. Some otoscopes can deliver a small
puff of air to the eardrum to see if the eardrum will
vibrate (which is normal). This type of ear examination
with an otoscope can also detect a build up of wax in the
ear canal, or a rupture or puncture of the eardrum.

A patient’s long-term prognosis depends upon the
root cause of the electrolyte disorder. However, when
treated quickly and appropriately, electrolyte imbalances
in and of themselves are usually effectively reversed.
When they are mild, some electrolyte imbalances
have few to no symptoms and may pass unnoticed. For
example, transient hyperphosphatemia is usually fairly
benign. However, long-term elevations of blood phos-
phate levels can lead to potentially fatal soft tissue and
vascular calcifications and bone disease, and severe
serum phosphate deficiencies (hypophosphatemia) can
cause encephalopathy, coma, and death.
Severe hypernatremia has a mortality rate of
40–60%. Death is commonly due to cerebrovascular
damage and hemorrhage resulting from dehydration and
shrinkage of the brain cells.

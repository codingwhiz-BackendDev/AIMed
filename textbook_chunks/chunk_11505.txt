A barium swallow is usually the first test performed
on a patient whose symptoms suggest esophageal cancer.
After the patient swallows a small amount of barium, a
series of x rays can highlight any bumps or flat raised
areas on the normally smooth surface of the esophageal
wall. It can also detect large, irregular areas that narrow
the esophagus in patients with advanced cancer, but it can-
not provide information about disease that has spread
beyond the esophagus. A double contrast study is a barium
swallow with air blown into the esophagus to improve the
way the barium coats the esophageal lining. Endoscopy is
a diagnostic procedure in which a thin lighted tube (endo-
scope) is passed through the mouth, down the throat, and
into the esophagus. Cells that appear abnormal are
removed for biopsy. Once a diagnosis of esophageal can-
cer has been confirmed through biopsy, staging tests are
performed to determine whether the disease has spread
(metastasized) to tissues or organs near the original tumor
or in other parts of the body. These tests may include com-
puted tomography, endoscopic ultrasound, thoracoscopy,
laparoscopy, and positron emission tomography.

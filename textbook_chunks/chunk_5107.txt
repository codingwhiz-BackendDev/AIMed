A major consideration with congenital abnormali-
ties is that they tend to be multiple. Further, each one
is unique in its extent and severity. Exstrophy can
involve the rectum and large bowel and coexist with
hernias. The obvious bladder exstrophy seen at birth
will prompt immediate action and a search for other
anomalies.
Diverticula are not visible and will be detected only
if they cause trouble. They are usually found in an
examination for the cause of recurring urinary infec-
tions. X rays of the urinary system or a cystoscopy
(examination with a telescope-like instrument) will
identify them. Often, the two procedures are done
together: a urologist will perform the cystoscopy, then a
radiologist will instill a contrast agent into the bladder
and take x rays.

Creatine kinase (CK or CPK) is an enzyme (a type
of protein) found in muscle and brain. Normally, very lit-
tle CK is found circulating in the blood. Elevated levels
indicate damage to either muscle or brain; possibly from
a myocardial infarction (heart attack), muscle disease,
or stroke.
There are three types, or isoforms, of CK:
• CK-I, or BB, is produced primarily by brain and
smooth muscle.
• CK-II, or MB, is produced primarily by heart muscle.
• CK-III, or MM, is produced primarily by skeletal muscle.

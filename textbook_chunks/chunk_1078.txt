Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy and,
along with fats and proteins, one of the three major nutri-
ents in the human diet. Carbohydrates are classified
according to their structure based on the number of basic
sugar, or saccharide units they contain.
A monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and
called a simple sugar. Simple sugars include glucose (the
form in which sugar circulates in the blood), fructose
(found in fruit and honey), and galactose (produced by
the digestion of milk). These simple sugars are important
because they can be absorbed by the small intestine. Two
simple sugars linked together make a disaccharide. The
disaccharide sugars present in the diet are maltose (a
product of the digestion of starch), sucrose (table sugar),
and lactose (the sugar in milk). These disaccharides must
be broken down by enzymes into two simple sugars so
that they can be absorbed by the intestine. Polysaccha-
rides are much more complex carbohydrates made up of
many simple sugars, the most important of which are
glycogen, which is stored in the liver, and starch.

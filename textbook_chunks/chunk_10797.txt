For many years the standard operation for BPH has
been transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate. Under
general or spinal anesthesia, a cystoscope is passed
through the urethra and prostate tissue surrounding the
urethra is removed using either a cutting instrument or a
heated wire loop. The small pieces of prostate tissue are
washed out through the scope. No incision is needed for
TUR. There normally is some blood in the urine for a
few days following the procedure. In a few men—less
than 5% of all those having TUR—urine will continue to
escape unintentionally. Other uncommon complications
include a temporary rise in blood pressure with mental
confusion, which is treated by giving salt solution. Impo-
tence—the inability to achieve lasting penile erections—
does occur, but probably in fewer than 10% of patients. A
narrowing or stricture rarely develops in the urethra, but
this can be treated fairly easily.

Imaging tests are important diagnostic tools for eval-
uating abnormal uterine bleeding. Ultrasound examina-
tion of the pelvic and abdominal area is used to help
locate uterine fibroids, also called uterine leiomyoma, a
type of tumor. Visual examination through hysterscopy—
where a camera inside a thin tube is inserted directly into
the uterus so that the doctor can see the uterine lining—is
also used to assess the condition of the uterus.
Hystersalpingography can help outline endometrial
polyps and fibroids and help detect endometrial cancer.
In this procedure an x ray is taken after contrast media
has been injected into the cervix. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the pelvic region can also be used to
locate fibroids and tumors.

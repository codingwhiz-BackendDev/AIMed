Of patients hospitalized with an arterial embolism,
25–30% die, and 5–25% require amputation of a limb.
About 10% of patients with a pulmonary embolism die
suddenly within the first hour of onset of the condition.
The outcome for all other patients is generally good; only
3% of patients die who are properly diagnosed early and
treated. In cases of an undiagnosed pulmonary
embolism, about 30% of patients die.

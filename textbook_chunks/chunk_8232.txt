sage of other, larger molecules. As blood is pushed
through the blood compartment in one direction, suction
or vacuum pressure pulls the dialysate through the
dialysate compartment in a countercurrent, or opposite
direction. These opposing pressures work to drain excess
fluids out of the bloodstream and into the dialysate, a
process called ultrafiltration.
A second process called diffusion moves waste
products in the blood across the membrane into the
dialysate compartment, where they are carried out of the
body. At the same time, electrolytes and other chemicals

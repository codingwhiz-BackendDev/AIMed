effective way to avoid infection. More studies are needed
to determine the appropriate safety margins for killing
these bacteria. Food irradiation methods are also being
developed to sanitize food. Vaccinations to E. coli 0157
are under development, as are medications aimed at lim-
iting the effects of the verotoxin. The enforcement of
regulations for meat production and water are critical.
Steam pasteurization is used in the United States and is

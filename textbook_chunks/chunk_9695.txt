Physical abnormalities point to Edwards’ syndrome,
but definitive diagnosis relies on karyotyping. Karyotyp-
ing involves drawing the baby’s blood or bone marrow
for a microscopic examination of the chromosomes.
Using special stains and microscopy, individual chromo-
somes are identified, and the presence of an extra chro-
mosome 18 is revealed.
Trisomy 18 can be detected before birth. If a preg-
nant woman is older than 35, has a family history of
genetic abnormalities, has previously conceived a child
with a genetic abnormality, or has suffered earlier miscar-
riages, she may undergo tests to determine whether her
child carries genetic abnormalities. Potential tests include
maternal serum analysis or screening, ultrasonography,
amniocentesis, and chorionic villus sampling.

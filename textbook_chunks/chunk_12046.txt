Depth perception (stereopsis) develops around the
age of three months old. For successful development of
binocular vision and the ability to perceive three-dimen-
sionally, the surgery should not be postponed past the age
of four. The earlier the surgery the better the outcome, so
an early diagnosis is important. Surgery may even be
performed before two years old. After surgery, if binocu-
lar vision is to develop, corrective lenses and eye exercis-
es (vision therapy) will probably be necessary.

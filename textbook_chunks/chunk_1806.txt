Bacterial infection of the CNS can result in abscess-
es and empyemas (accumulations of pus). Abscesses
have fixed boundaries, but empyemas lack definable
shape and size. CNS infections are classified according
to the location where they occur. For example, a spinal
epidural abscess is located above the dura mater, and a
cranial subdural empyema occurs between the dura
mater and the arachnoid.
As pus and other material from an infection accumu-
late, pressure is exerted on the brain or spinal cord. This
pressure can damage the nervous system tissue, possibly
permanently. Without treatment, a CNS infection is fatal.

Eyelids consist of thin folds of skin, muscle, and
connective tissue. The eyelids protect the eyes and spread
tears over the front of the eyes. The inside of the eyelids
are lined with the conjunctiva of the eyelid (the palpebral
conjunctiva), and the outside of the lids are covered with
the bodyâ€™s thinnest skin. Some common lid problems
include the following: stye, blepharitis, chalazion, entro-
pion, ectropion, eyelid edema, and eyelid tumors.

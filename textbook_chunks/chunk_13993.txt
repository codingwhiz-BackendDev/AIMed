Emergency medical help should always be sum-
moned whenever frostbite is suspected. While waiting for
help to arrive, one should, if possible, remove wet or tight
clothing and put on dry, loose clothing or wraps. A splint
and padding are used to protect the injured area. Rubbing
the area with snow or anything else is dangerous. The key
to prehospital treatment is to avoid partial thawing and
refreezing, which releases more inflammatory mediators
and makes the injury substantially worse. For this reason,
the affected part must be kept away from heat sources such
as campfires and car heaters. Experts advise rewarming in
the field only when emergency help will take more than
two hours to arrive and refreezing can be prevented.
Because the outcome of a frostbite injury cannot be
predicted at first, all hospital treatment follows the same

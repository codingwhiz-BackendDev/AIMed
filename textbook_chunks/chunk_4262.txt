Alternative treatment for fungal infections focuses
on creating an internal environment where the fungus
cannot survive. This is accomplished by eating a diet low
in dairy products, sugars, including honey and fruit juice,
and foods like beer that contain yeast. This is comple-
mented by a diet consisting, in large part, of uncooked
and unprocessed foods. Supplements of vitamins C, E,
A-plus, and B complex may also be useful. Lactobacillus
acidophilus and Bifidobacterium will replenish the good
bacteria in the intestines. Antifungal herbs, like garlic
(Allium sativum), can be consumed in relatively large
does and for an extended period of time in order to
increase effectiveness.

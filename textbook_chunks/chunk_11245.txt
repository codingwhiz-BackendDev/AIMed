Penicillin is the drug of choice for treating erysipelas.
It can usually be given by mouth, although in severe cases
(or in cases of diagnosed bacteremia) it may be given
through a needle placed in a vein (intravenously).
Even with antibiotic treatment, swelling may contin-
ue to spread. Other symptoms, such as fever, pain, and
redness, usually decrease rapidly after penicillin is start-
ed. Cold packs and pain relievers may help decrease dis-
comfort. Within about five to 10 days, the affected skin
may begin drying up and flaking off.

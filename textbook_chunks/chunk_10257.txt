phy identifies the location, extent, and degree of attach-
ment of the blood clots and enables the condition of the
deep leg veins to be assessed. A contrast solution is

observes the movement of the solution through the vein
with a fluoroscope while a series of x rays are taken.
Venography takes between 30–45 minutes and can be
done in a physician’s office, a laboratory, or a hospital.
Radionuclide venography, in which a radioactive isotope
is injected, is occasionally used, especially if a patient
has had reactions to contrast solutions. Venous ultra-
sound is the preferred evaluation of leg veins.

Dysmenorrhea is called “primary” when there is no
specific abnormality, and “secondary” when the pain is
caused by an underlying gynecological problem. It is
believed that primary dysmenorrhea occurs when hor-
mone-like substances called “prostaglandins” produced
by uterine tissue trigger strong muscle contractions in the
uterus during menstruation. However, the level of
prostaglandins doesn’t seem to have anything to do with
how strong a woman’s cramps are. Some women have
high levels of prostaglandins and no cramps, whereas
other women with low levels have severe cramps. This is
why experts assume that cramps must also be related to
other things (such as genetics, stress, and different body
types) in addition to prostaglandins. The first year or two of
a girl’s periods are not usually very painful. However, once
ovulation begins, the blood levels of the prostaglandins
rise, leading to stronger contractions.
Secondary dysmenorrhea may be caused by endo-
metriosis, fibroid tumors, or an infection in the pelvis.
The likelihood that a woman will have cramps
increases if she:
• has a family history of painful periods
• leads a stressful life
• doesn’t get enough exercise
• uses caffeine
• has pelvic inflammatory disease

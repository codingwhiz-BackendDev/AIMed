The fascia is thin connective tissue covering, or sep-
arating, the muscles and internal organs of the body. It
varies in thickness, density, elasticity, and composition,
and is different from ligaments and tendons.
The fascia can be injured either through constant
strain or through trauma. Fasciitis is an inflammation of
the fascia. The most common condition for which fas-
ciotomy is performed is plantar fasciitis, an inflamma-
tion of the fascia on the bottom of the foot that is some-
times called a heel spur or stone bruise.

Cerebral aneurysms can be caused by brain trauma,
infection, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), or
abnormal rapid cell growth (neoplastic disease), but most
seem to arise from a congenital, or developmental,
defect. These congenital aneurysms occur more frequent-
ly in women. Whatever the cause may be, the inner wall
of the blood vessel is abnormally thin and the pressure of
the blood flow causes an aneurysm to form.
Most aneurysms go unnoticed until they rupture.
However, 10â€“15% of unruptured cerebral aneurysms are
found because of their size or their location. Common
warning signs include symptoms that affect only one eye,
such as an enlarged pupil, a drooping eyelid, or pain
above or behind the eye. Other symptoms are a localized
headache, unsteady gait, a temporary problem with
sight, double vision, or numbness in the face.
Some aneurysms bleed occasionally without rupturing.

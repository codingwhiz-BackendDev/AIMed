An embolism can be diagnosed through the patientâ€™s
history, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests. For arterial
emboli, cardiac ultrasound and/or arteriography are
ordered. For a pulmonary embolism, a chest x ray, lung
scan, pulmonary angiography, electrocardiography,
arterial blood gas measurements, and venography or
venous ultrasound could be ordered.

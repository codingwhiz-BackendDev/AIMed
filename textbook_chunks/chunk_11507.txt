Treatment for esophageal cancer is determined by the
stage of the disease and the patientâ€™s general health. The
most important distinction to make is whether the cancer
is curable. If the cancer is in the early stages, cure may be
possible. If the cancer is advanced or if the patient will
not tolerate major surgery, treatment is usually directed at
palliation (relief of symptoms only) instead of cure.

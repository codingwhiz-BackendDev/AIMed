The body scan can identify abnormal body structures
and organs. Throughout the body, a CT may indicate
tumors or cysts, enlarged lymph nodes, abnormal collec-
tions of fluids, blood or fat, and metastasis of cancer.
Tumors resulting from metastasis are different in makeup
than primary tumors, or those that originate in the loca-
tion of study. Fractures or damage to soft tissues and liga-
ments will be more easily seen on the sensitive images
produced by CT scanning, though CT is not usually done
for these. Liver conditions, such as cirrhosis or abscessed
or fatty liver, may be observed on the body scan.

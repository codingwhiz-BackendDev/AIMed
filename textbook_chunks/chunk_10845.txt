The initial treatment of enterobacterial diarrhea is
usually empiric. Empiric means that the doctor treats the
patient on the basis of the visible symptoms and profes-
sional experience in treating infections, without waiting
for laboratory test results. Since the results of stool cul-
tures can take as long as two days, it is important to pre-
vent dehydration. The patient will be given fluids to
restore the electrolyte balance and paregoric to relieve
abdominal cramping.
Newborn infants and patients with immune system
disorders will be given antibiotics intravenously once the
organism has been identified. Gentamicin, tobramycin,
and amikacin are being used more frequently to treat
enterobacterial infections because many of the organisms
are becoming resistant to ampicillin and cephalosporin
antibiotics.

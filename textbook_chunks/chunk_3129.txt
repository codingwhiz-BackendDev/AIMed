Chlamydia psittaci can be prevented by warning peo-
ple who have birds as pets, or who work around birds, to
be careful to avoid contact with the dust and droppings of
these birds. Sick birds can be treated with an antibiotic in
their feed. Because people can contract psittacosis from
each other, a person sick with this infection should be
kept in isolation, so as not to infect other people.
Chlamydia pneumoniae is difficult to prevent
because it is spread by respiratory droplets from other
sick people. Because people with this type of pneumonia
do not always feel very sick, they often continue to
attend school, go to work, and go to other public places.
They then spread the bacteria in the tiny droplets that are
released into the air during coughing. Therefore, this
pneumonia is very difficult to prevent and often occurs in
outbreaks within communities.

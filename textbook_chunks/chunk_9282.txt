The underlying cause of dyslexia is not known,
although research suggests the condition is often inherit-
ed. In 1999, The Centre for Reading Research in Norway
presented the first research to study the largest family
with reading problems ever known. By studying the read-
ing and writing abilities of close to 80 family members
across four generations the researchers reported, for the
first time, that chromosome 2 can be involved in the
inheritability of dyslexia. When a fault occurs on this
gene it leads to difficulties in processing written lan-
guage. Previous studies have pointed out linkages of other
potential dyslexia genes to chromosome 1, chromosome
15 (DYX1 gene), and to chromosome 6 (DYX2 gene).
The researchers who pinpointed the newly localized gene
on chromosome 2 (DYX3) hope that this finding will lead
to earlier and more precise diagnoses of dyslexia.
New research suggests a possible link with a subtle
visual problem that affects the speed with which affected

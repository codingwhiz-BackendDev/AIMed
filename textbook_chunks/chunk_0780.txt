There is evidence to prove that certain occupational
hazards account for 4% of all cancer deaths. For exam-
ple, asbestos workers have an increased incidence of
lung cancer. Similarly, a higher likelihood of getting
bladder cancer is associated with dye, rubber and gas
workers; skin and lung cancer with smelters, gold miners
and arsenic workers; leukemia with glue and varnish
workers; liver cancer with PVC manufacturers; and lung,
bone and bone marrow cancer with radiologists and ura-
nium miners.

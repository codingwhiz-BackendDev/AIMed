There is no treatment for FAS that will reverse or
change the physical features or brain damage associated
with maternal alcohol use during the pregnancy. Most of
the birth defects associated with prenatal alcohol expo-
sure are correctable with surgery. Children should have
psychoeducational evaluation to help plan appropriate
educational interventions. Common associated diagnoses
such as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, depres-
sion, or anxiety should be recognized and treated appro-
priately. The disabilities that present during childhood
persist into adult life. However, some of the secondary
disabilities mentioned above may be avoided or lessened
by early and correct diagnosis, better understanding of
the life-long complications of FAS, and intervention.
Streissguth has describe a model in which an individual
affected by FAS has one or more advocates to help pro-
vide guidance, structure and support as the individual
seeks to become independent, successful in school or
employment, and develop satisfying social relationships.

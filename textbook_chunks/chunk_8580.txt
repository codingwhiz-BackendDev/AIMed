The most important step is prompt administration of
diphtheria antitoxin, without waiting for laboratory
results. The antitoxin is made from horse serum and
works by neutralizing any circulating exotoxin. The doc-
tor must first test the patient for sensitivity to animal
serum. Patients who are sensitive (about 10%) must be
desensitized with diluted antitoxin, since the antitoxin is
the only specific substance that will counteract diphthe-
ria exotoxin. No human antitoxin is available for the
treatment of diphtheria.
The dose ranges from 20,000â€“100,000 units,
depending on the severity and length of time of symp-
toms occurring before treatment. Diphtheria antitoxin is
usually given intravenously.

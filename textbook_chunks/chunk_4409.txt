There is no cure for herpes virus infections. There
are antiviral drugs available that have some effect on
lessening the symptoms and decreasing the length of her-
pes outbreaks. There is evidence that some may also pre-
vent future outbreaks. These antiviral drugs work by
interfering with the replication of the viruses, and are
most effective when taken as early in the infection
process as possible. For the best results, drug treatment
should begin during the prodrome stage before blisters
are visible. Depending on the length of the outbreak,
drug treatment could continue for up to 10 days.
Acyclovir (Zovirax) is the drug of choice for herpes
infection and can be given intravenously or taken by
mouth. It can be applied directly to sores as an ointment
but is not very useful in this form. A liquid form for chil-
dren is also available. Acyclovir is effective in treating
both the primary infection and recurrent outbreaks.
When taken by mouth to prevent an outbreak, acyclovir
reduces the frequency of herpes outbreaks.
During an outbreak of cold sores, salty foods, citrus
foods (oranges etc.), and other foods that irritate the sores
should be avoided. Wash the sores once or twice a day
with warm, soapy water and pat gently to dry. Over-the-
counter lip products that contain the chemical phenol
(such as Blistex Medicated Lip Ointment) and numbing
ointments (Anbesol) help to relieve cold sores. A bandage
may be placed over the sores to protect them and prevent
spreading the virus to other sites on the lips or face.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)
may be taken if necessary to reduce pain and fever.

Enterostomies are performed in order to create a
new opening for the passage of fecal matter when normal
intestinal functioning is interrupted or when diseases of
the intestines cannot be treated by medications or less
radical surgery. Some situations that may require entero-
stomies include:
• Healing of inflamed bowel segments. Enterostomies
performed for this reason are usually temporary.
• Emergency treatment of gunshot or other penetrating
wounds of the abdomen. An enterostomy is needed to
prevent the contents of the intestine from causing a seri-
ous inflammation of the inside of the abdominal cavity
(peritonitis). These enterostomies are also often tem-
porary.
• Placement of a tube for enteral feeding. Enteral feeding
is a method for conveying nutritional solutions directly
into the stomach or jejunum through a tube. Tube
enterostomies may be long-term but are not permanent.
• Removal of diseased sections of the intestines.
Ileostomies performed for this reason are permanent.
The most common disorders requiring permanent
ileostomy are Crohn’s disease, familial polyposis, and
ulcerative colitis. Familial polyposis and ulcerative
colitis are serious health risks because they can develop
into cancer.
• Treatment of advanced cancer or other causes of intesti-
nal obstruction.

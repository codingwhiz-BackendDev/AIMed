Prenatal therapy, in which a pregnant woman at risk
for a second CAH child is given dexamethasone to
decrease secretion of androgens by the adrenal glands of
the female fetus, has been in use for about 10 years. This
therapy is started in the first trimester when fetal adrenal
production of androgens begins, but before prenatal diag-
nosis is done that would provide definitive information
about the sex of the fetus and its disease status. This
means that a number of fetuses are exposed to unneces-
sary steroid treatment in order to prevent the develop-
ment of male-like genitals in female fetuses with CAH.
Several hundred children have undergone this treatment
with no major adverse effects, but its long-term risks are
unknown. Since there is very little data on the effective-
ness and safety of prenatal therapy, it should only be
offered to patients who clearly understand the risks and
benefits and who are capable of complying with strict
monitoring and follow-up throughout pregnancy and
after the child is born.
Parents with a family history of CAH, including a
child who has CAH, should seek genetic counseling.
Genetic testing during pregnancy can provide informa-
tion on the risk of having a child with CAH.

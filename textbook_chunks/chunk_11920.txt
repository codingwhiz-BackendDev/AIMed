An ophthalmologist makes a diagnosis. The doctor
is usually able to see the tumor through the pupil or
directly on the iris if the cancer is intraocular melanoma
of the iris. Because the doctor can usually readily see the
tumor a biopsy is rarely needed.
An ultrasound or a fluorescein angiography are two
tests doctors use to further diagnose eye cancers. In an
ultrasound sound waves are pointed at the tumor and
depending on how they reflect off the tumor the doctor
can better diagnose it. In a fluorescein angiography a flu-
orescent dye is injected into the patients arm. When this
dye circulates through the body and reaches the eye a
series of rapid pictures are taken through the pupil. The
tumor will show up in these photos.
Once a diagnosis has been made, the treatment can
begin.

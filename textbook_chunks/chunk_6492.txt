Extensive preparation prior to cryotherapy is not
required. The area to be treated should be clean and dry,
but sterile preparation is not necessary. Patients should
know that they will experience some pain at the time of
the freezing, but local anesthesia is usually not required.
The physician may want to reduce the size of certain
growths, such as warts, prior to the cryotherapy proce-
dure, and may have patients apply salicylic acid prepara-
tions to the growth over several weeks. Sometimes, the
physician will pare away some of the tissue using a
device called a curette or a scalpel.

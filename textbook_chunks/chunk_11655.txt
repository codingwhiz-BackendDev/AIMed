Hair must be clean, dry, and free of any braids, pins,
or jewelry. The patient should shampoo before the test,
and must not use any hair spray, gel, or other hair care
products after shampooing. Clothing should be loose and
comfortable. The patient may eat and take some medica-
tions as usual before the test, although sedative medica-
tions should be avoided on the day of the test, if possible.
It is best to check with the physician supervising the test
for specific instructions.

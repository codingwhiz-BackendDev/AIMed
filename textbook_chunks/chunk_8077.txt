Diet and moderate exercise are the first treatments
implemented in diabetes. For many Type II diabetics,
weight loss may be an important goal in helping them to
control their diabetes. A well-balanced, nutritious diet pro-
vides approximately 50–60% of calories from carbohy-
drates, approximately 10–20% of calories from protein,
and less than 30% of calories from fat. The number of
calories required by an individual depends on their age,
weight, and activity level. The calorie intake also needs to
be distributed over the course of the entire day so surges of
glucose entering the blood system are kept to a minimum.
Keeping track of the number of calories provided by
different foods can become complicated, so patients are
usually advised to consult a nutritionist or dietitian. An
individualized, easy to manage diet plan can be set up for
each patient. Both the American Diabetes Association and
the American Dietetic Association recommend diets based
on the use of food exchange lists. Each food exchange
contains a known amount of calories in the form of pro-
tein, fat, or carbohydrate. A patient’s diet plan will consist
of a certain number of exchanges from each food category
(meat or protein, fruits, breads and starches, vegetables,
and fats) to be eaten at meal times and as snacks. Patients
have flexibility in choosing which foods they eat as long
as they stick with the number of exchanges prescribed.
For many Type II diabetics, weight loss is an impor-
tant factor in controlling their condition. The food
exchange system, along with a plan of moderate exer-
cise, can help them lose excess weight and improve their
overall health.

The purpose of the TC test is to measure the levels
of cholesterol in the patient’s blood. The patient’s choles-
terol can also be fractionated (separated into different
portions) in order to determine the TC/HDL ratio. The
results help the doctor to assess the patient’s risk for
coronary artery disease (CAD). High LDL levels are
associated with increased risk of CAD whereas high
HDL levels are associated with relatively lower risk.
In addition, the results of the cholesterol test can
assist the doctor in evaluating the patient’s metabolism of
fat, or in diagnosing inflammation of the pancreas, liver
disease, or disorders of the thyroid gland.
The frequency of cholesterol testing depends on the
patient’s degree of risk for CAD. People with low choles-
terol levels may need to be tested once every five years.
People with high levels of blood cholesterol should be
tested more frequently, according to their doctor’s advice.
The doctor may recommend a detailed evaluation of the
different types of lipids in the patient’s blood. It is ideal to
check the HDL and triglycerides as well as the cholesterol
and LDL. In addition, the National Cholesterol Education
Program (NCEP) suggests further evaluation if the patient
has any of the symptoms of CAD or if she or he has two
or more of the following risk factors for CAD:
• male sex
• high blood pressure
• smoking
• diabetes
• low HDL levels
• family history of CAD before age 55

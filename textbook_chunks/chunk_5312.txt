With this syndrome, blood reaches the aorta, which
pumps blood to the entire body, only from the ductus,
which then normally closes within a few days of birth. In
hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the baby seems normal
at birth, but as the ductus closes, blood cannot reach the
aorta and circulation fails.

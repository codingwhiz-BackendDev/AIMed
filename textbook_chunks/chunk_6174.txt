According to Upledger, craniosacral therapy is ide-
ally suited for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), headaches, chronic middle ear infection, pain,
and general health maintenance. It is recommended for
autism, fibromyalgia, heart disease, osteoarthritis,
pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic sinus infec-
tions, and gastroenteritis (inflammation of the lining of
the stomach or small intestine). It is also used with other
therapies to treat chronic fatigue syndrome, back pain,
and menstrual irregularity. In addition, other craniosacral
practitioners have reported benefits for eye dysfunction,
dyslexia, depression, motor coordination difficulties,
temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD), hyperac-
tivity, colic, asthma in babies, floppy baby syndrome,
whiplash, cerebral palsy, certain birth defects, and
other central nervous system disorders.

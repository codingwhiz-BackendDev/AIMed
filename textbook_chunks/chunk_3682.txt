CFS is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms and elim-
inating other causes of fatigue. Doctors carefully ques-
tion patients about their symptoms, any other illnesses
they have had, and medications they are taking. They
also conduct a physical examination, neurological
examination, and laboratory tests to identify any underly-
ing disorders or other diseases that cause fatigue. In the
United States, many doctors use the CDC case definition
to determine if a patient has CFS.
To be diagnosed with CFS, patients must meet both
of the following criteria:
• Unexplained continuing or recurring chronic fatigue for
at least six months that is of new or definite onset, is not
the result of ongoing exertion, and is not mainly
relieved by rest, and causes occupational, educational,
social, or personal activities to be greatly reduced.
• Four or more of the following symptoms: loss of short-
term memory or ability to concentrate; sore throat; tender
lymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain without
swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, or
severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertional malaise
(a vague feeling of discomfort or tiredness following
exercise or other physical or mental activity) lasting more
than 24 hours. These symptoms must have continued or
recurred during six or more consecutive months of illness
and must not have started before the fatigue began.

Colposcopy is a procedure that allows a physician to
take a closer look at a womanâ€™s cervix and vagina using a
special instrument called a colposcope. It is used to
check for precancerous or abnormal areas. The colpo-
scope can magnify the area between 10 and 40 times;
some devices also can take photographs.

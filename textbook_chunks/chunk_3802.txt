Definition
Chronic obstructive lung disease, also known as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a gen-
eral term for a group of conditions in which there is per-
sistent difficulty in expelling (or exhaling) air from the
lungs. COPD commonly refers to two related, progres-
sive diseases of the respiratory system, chronic bronchi-
tis and emphysema. Because smoking is the major
cause of both diseases, chronic bronchitis and emphyse-
ma often occur together in the same patient.

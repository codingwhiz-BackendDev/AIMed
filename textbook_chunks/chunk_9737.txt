Individuals with this type of EDS, once called type
VIIC, have extremely fragile skin that bruises easily but
does not scar excessively. The skin is soft and may sag,
leading to an aged appearance even in young adults. Indi-
viduals may also experience hernias. Dermatosparaxis
type is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
There are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS dematosparaxis type. These include severe skin
fragility and sagging or aged appearing skin. This form of
EDS is caused by a change in the enzyme called procolla-
gen I N-terminal peptidase. A skin biopsy may be pre-
formed for a definitive diagnosis of Dermatosparaxis type.

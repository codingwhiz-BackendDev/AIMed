Although rare, very serious reactions to azithromycin
(Zithromax) are possible, including extreme swelling of
the lips, face, and neck, and anaphylaxis (a violent aller-
gic reaction). Anyone who develops these symptoms after
taking azithromycin should stop taking the medicine and
get immediate medical help.

after taking these medicines should get in touch with his
or her physician.

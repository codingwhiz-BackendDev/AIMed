The major symptoms of kyphoscoliosis type, for-
merly called EDS type VI, are general joint looseness. At
birth, the muscle tone is poor, and motor skill develop-
ment is subsequently delayed. Also, infants with this type
of EDS have an abnormal curvature of the spine (scolio-
sis). The scoliosis becomes progressively worse with
age, with affected individuals usually unable to walk by
age 20. The eyes and skin are fragile and easily damaged,
and blood vessel involvement is a possibility. The bones
may also be affected as demonstrated by a decrease in
bone mass. Kyphoscoliosis type is inherited in an autoso-
mal recessive manner.
There are four major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS kyphoscoliosis type. These include generaly loose
joints, low muscle tone at birth, scoliosis at birth (which
worsens with age), and a fragility of the eyes, which may
give the white area of the eye a blue tint or cause the eye
to rupture. This form of EDS is caused by a change in the
PLOD gene on chromosome 1, which encodes the
enzyme lysyl hydroxylase. A laboratory test is available
in which urinary hydroxylysyl pryridinoline is measured.
This test, performed on urine is extremely senstive and
specific for EDS kyphoscolios type. Laboratory testing is
recommended for infants with three or more of the major
diagnostic criteria.
Prenatal testing is available if a pregnancy is known
to be at risk and an identified affected family member has
had positive laboratory testing. An amniocentesis may
be performed in which fetal cells are removed from the
amniotic fluid and enzyme activity is measured.

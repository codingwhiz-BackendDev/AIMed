The most important and difficult aspect of CVS is to
be sure there is not an acute and life-threatening event in
progress. So many diseases can cause vomiting—from
bowel obstruction to epilepsy—that an accurate and time-
ly diagnosis is critical. Because there is no way to prove
the diagnosis of CVS, the physician must instead disprove
every other diagnosis. This can be tedious, expensive,
exhausting, and involve almost every system in the body.
The first episode may be diagnosed as a stomach flu when
nothing more serious turns up. Only after several episodes
and several fruitless searches for a cause will a physician
normally consider the diagnosis of CVS.

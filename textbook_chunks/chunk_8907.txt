Doppler ultrasonography can detect the direction,
velocity, and turbulence of blood flow. It is frequently
used to detect problems with heart valves or to measure
blood flow through the arteries. Specifically, it is useful
in the work up of stroke patients, in assessing blood flow
in the abdomen or legs, and in viewing the heart to moni-
tor carotid artery diseases.

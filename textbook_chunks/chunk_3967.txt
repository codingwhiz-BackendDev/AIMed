pregnancy. Some drugs also increase the incidence of
clefting, such as phenytoin, sodium valproate, and
methotrexate. The pregnant mother’s nutrition may
affect the incidence of clefting as well.
Babies born with a cleft lip will be seen to have an
elongated opening in the upper lip. The size of this opening
may range from a small notch in the upper lip to an open-
ing that extends into the base of the nostril. The cleft lip
may be below the right or left nostril or below both nostrils.
Babies born with a cleft palate will be seen to have
an opening into the roof of the mouth. The size and posi-
tion of the cleft varies and it may involve only the hard
palate, or only the soft palate and may occur on both
sides of the center of the palate.
In some cases the cleft palate will be covered with
the normal lining of the mouth and can only be felt by
the examiner.
Babies with cleft lips and palates have feeding diffi-
culties, which are more severe in babies with cleft
palates. The difficulty in feeding is due to the baby being
unable to achieve complete suction. In the case of clefts
of the hard palate, liquids enter the nose from the mouth
through the opening in the hard palate.
A cleft palate also affects a child’s speech, since the
palate is necessary for speech formation. The child’s
speech pattern may still be affected despite surgical repair.
Ear infections are more common in babies born with
cleft palates. The infections occur because the muscles of
the palate do not open the Eustachian tubes which drain
the middle ear. This allows fluid to collect and increases
the risk of infection and hearing loss.
Teeth may also erupt misaligned.

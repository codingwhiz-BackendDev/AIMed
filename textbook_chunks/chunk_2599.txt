Between each vertebra lies a disk of cushioning
material that keeps the spinal bones from rubbing togeth-
er and absorbs some of the shock to the spine from body
movements. In the center of the disk is soft, gelatinous
material called the nucleus pulposus (NP). The NP is sur-
rounded by a tough fibrous coating. Sometimes when the
back is injured, this coating can weaken and bulge or tear
to allow the NP to ooze out. When this happens, it is
called a herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), or—in com-
mon language—a herniated disk.
When the disk bulges or herniates, it can put pres-
sure on nerves which originate in the spinal column, and
go to other parts of the body. This causes lower back
pain, and/or pain to the hips, legs, arms, shoulders, and
neck, depending on the location of the herniated disk.
Chemonucleolysis uses chymopapain, an enzyme de-
rived from papyrus, to dissolve the disk material that has

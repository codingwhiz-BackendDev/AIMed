Tests that measure a specific type of antibody help
tell the difference between a current and a past infection.
Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies appear at the
beginning of an infection and last only weeks.
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies appear 10–14 days
later and can last a lifetime. A person suspected of hav-
ing a current infection should be tested at the beginning
of the infection and again 10–14 days later.
The CMV antibody screening test is also called the
transplant reaction screening test. Results are usually
available the following day.

In the hospital setting, the best means of avoiding
transmission of infection is the use of good hand-wash-
ing practices and other appropriate precautions (gowns
and gloves for hospital staff). The virus is found in feces
for up to one week after infection; therefore precautions
that isolate waste material (enteric precautions) will help
decrease the chance of spreading the illness.

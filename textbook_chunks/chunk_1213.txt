Cardiac catheterization is categorized as an “inva-
sive” procedure which involves the heart, its valves, and
coronary arteries, in addition to a large artery in the arm
or leg. Due to the nature of the test, it is important to
evaluate for the following conditions before considering
this procedure:
• A diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, poor kidney func-
tion, or debilitation. Any of these pre-existing condi-
tions typically raises the risk of the catheterization pro-
cedure and may be reason to cancel the procedure.
• A diagnosis of heart valve disease. If this is detected,
antibiotics may be given before the test to prevent
inflammation of the membrane which lines the heart
(endocarditis).

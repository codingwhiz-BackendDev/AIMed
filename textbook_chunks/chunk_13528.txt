Folic acid is a water-soluable vitamin belonging to the
B-complex group of vitamins. These vitamins help the
body break down complex carbohydrates into simple sug-
ars to be used for energy. Excess B vitamins are excreted
from the body rather than stored for later use. This is why
sufficient daily intake of folic acid is necessary.

Uncomplicated cases of the E. coli O157:H7 the
infection clear up within ten days. It is not certain that
antibiotics are helpful in treating E. coli O157:H7 and
there is some evidence that they may be harmful. Dehy-
dration resulting from diarrhea must be treated with either
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or intravenous fluids.
Anti-motility agents that decrease the intestinesâ€™ ability to
contract, should not be used in any patient with bloody
diarrhea. Treatment of HUS, if it develops, involves cor-
rection of clotting factors, plasma exchange, and kidney
dialysis. Blood transfusions may be required. Treatment
methods for other E. coli infections are similar. Antibiotics
are often used in the treatment of E. coli infections, but
their role is controversial. Some antibiotics may enhance
the development of HUS/TTP depending upon their
action, as well as the use of anti diarrhea medications that
should be avoided. Phosphoenolpyruvate analogues may
be helpful. Gentamicin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, or beta-
lactamase-stable cephalosporin may be administered for
neonatal meningitis. Antibiotic therapy is further compli-
cated by the presence of antibiotic resistant organisms.

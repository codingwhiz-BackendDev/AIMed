Anemia—A disorder characterized by a reduced
blood level of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying
pigment of blood.
Hemolytic anemia—A form of anemia caused by
premature destruction of red cells in the blood
stream (a process called hemolysis). Hemolytic
anemias are classified according to whether the
cause of the problem is inside the red blood cell
(in which case it is usually an inherited condition),
or outside the cell (usually acquired later in life).

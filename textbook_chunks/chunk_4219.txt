A wide range of behavioral interventions have been
successfully used to treat cocaine addiction. The
approach used must be tailored to the specific needs of
each individual patient, however.
Contingency management rewards drug abstinence
(confirmed by urine testing) with points or vouchers
which patients can exchange for such things as an
evening out or membership in a gym. Cognitive-behav-
ioral therapy helps users learn to recognize and avoid
situations most likely to lead to cocaine use and to devel-
op healthier ways to cope with stressful situations. Resi-
dential programs/therapeutic communities may also be
helpful, particularly in more severe cases. Patients typi-
cally spend six to 12 months in such programs, which
may also include vocational training and other features.

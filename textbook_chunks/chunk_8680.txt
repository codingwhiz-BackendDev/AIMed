In a healthy joint, the bones are normally held
together with tough, fibrous bands called ligaments.
These ligaments are attached to each bone along with a
fibrous sac surrounding the joint called the articular cap-
sule or joint capsule. The ligaments and joint capsule are
relatively strong and nonelastic but permit movement
within normal limits for each particular joint. In the event
of a dislocation, one of the bones making up the joint is
forced out of its natural alignment from excessive
stretching and tearing of the joint ligaments and capsule.
Muscles and tendons surrounding the joint are usually
stretched and injured to some degree.

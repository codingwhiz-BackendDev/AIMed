TC levels less than 160 mg/dL are associated with
higher mortality rates from cancer, liver disease, respira-
tory disorders, and injuries. The connection between
unusually low cholesterol and increased mortality is not
clear, although some researchers think that the low level
is a secondary sign of the underlying disease and not the
cause of disease or death.
Low levels of serum cholesterol are also associated
with malnutrition or hyperthyroidism. Further diagnos-
tic testing may be necessary in order to locate the cause.

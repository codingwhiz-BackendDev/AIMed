The after-effects of a c-section vary, depending on
the woman’s age, physical fitness, and overall health.
Following this procedure, a woman commonly experi-
ences gas pains, incision pain, and uterine contractions—
which are also common in vaginal delivery. Her hospital
stay may be two to four days. Breastfeeding the baby is
encouraged, taking care that it is in a position that keeps
the baby from resting on the mother’s incision. As the
woman heals, she may gradually increase appropriate
exercises to regain abdominal tone. Full recovery may be
seen in four to six weeks.
The prognosis for a successful vaginal birth after a
cesarean (VBAC) may be at least 75%, especially when the
c-section involved a low transverse incision in the uterus
and there were no complications during or after delivery.

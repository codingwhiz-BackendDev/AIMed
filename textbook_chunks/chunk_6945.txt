People with CF may lead relatively normal lives with
the control of symptoms. The possible effect of pregnancy
on the health of a woman with CF requires careful consid-
eration before beginning a family as do issues of longevi-
ty and their childrenâ€™s status as carriers. Although most
men with CF are functionally sterile, new procedures for
removing sperm from the testes are being tried, and may
offer more men the chance to become fathers.
Approximately half of people with CF live past the
age of 30. Because of better and earlier treatment, a per-
son born today with CF is expected, on average, to live to
age 40.

The nasal septum is composed of two parts. Toward
the back of the head the nasal septum is rigid bone, but
further forward the bone becomes cartilage. With one
finger in each nostril this cartilage can easily be bent
back and forth. If the nasal septum is sufficiently dis-
placed to one side, it will impede the flow of air and
mucus through the nose. This condition, called a deviat-
ed septum, can cause symptoms and disease.

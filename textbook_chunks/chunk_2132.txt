how far the cancer has spread). For example, additional
pelvic exams may be performed under anesthesia.
There are several procedures for determining if cer-
vical cancer has invaded the urinary tract. With cys-
toscopy, a lighted tube with a lens is inserted through the
urethra (the urine tube from the bladder to the exterior)
and into the bladder to examine these organs for cancer-
ous cells. Tissue samples may be removed for micro-
scopic examination by a pathologist. Intravenous urog-
raphy (intravenous pyelogram or IVP) is an x ray of the
urinary system, following the injection of special dye.
The kidneys remove the dye from the bloodstream and
the dye passes into the ureters (the tubes from the kid-
neys to the bladder) and bladder. IVP can detect a
blocked ureter, caused by the spread of cancer to the
pelvic lymph nodes (small glands that are part of the
immune system).
A procedure called proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is
similar to cystoscopy. It is used to determine whether the
cancer has spread to the rectum or lower large intestine.
Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans, ultra-
sound, or other imaging techniques may be used to deter-
mine the spread of cancer to various parts of the body.
With a CT scan, an x-ray beam rotates around the body,
taking images from various angles. It is used to deter-
mine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses a magnetic
field to image the body, sometimes is used for evaluating
the spread of cervical cancer. Chest x rays may be used
to detect cervical cancer that has spread to the lungs.

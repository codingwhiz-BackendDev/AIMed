Chronic constipation may be a symptom of colorec-
tal cancer, depression, diabetes, diverticulosis (small
pouches in the muscles of the large intestine), lead poi-
soning, or Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
In someone who is elderly or disabled, constipation
may be a symptom of bowel impaction, a more serious
condition in which feces are trapped in the lower part of
the large intestine. A doctor should be called if an elderly
or disabled person is constipated for a week or more or if
a child seems to be constipated.
A doctor should be notified whenever constipation
occurs after starting a new prescription, vitamin, or min-
eral supplement or is accompanied by blood in the stools,
changes in bowel patterns, or fever and abdominal pain.

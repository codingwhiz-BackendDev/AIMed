es. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) or intravenous fluids
are the choices; ORS is preferred if possible.
A physician should be notified if the patient is dehy-
drated, and if oral replacement is suggested then com-
mercial (Pedialyte and others) or homemade preparations
can be used. The World Health Organization (WHO) has
provided this easy recipe for home preparation, which
can be taken in small frequent sips:
• Table salt—3/4 tsp
• Baking powder—1 tsp
• Orange juice—1 c
• Water—1 qt (1 L)
When feasible, food intake should be continued even
in those with acute diarrhea. A physician should be con-
sulted as to what type and how much food is permitted.
Anti-motility agents (loperamide, diphenoxylate)
are useful for those with chronic symptoms; their use is
limited or even contraindicated in most individuals with
acute diarrhea, especially in those with high fever or
bloody bowel movements. They should not be taken
without the advice of a physician.
Other treatments are available, depending on the
cause of symptoms. For example, the bulk agent psylli-
um helps some patients by absorbing excess fluid and
solidifying stools; cholestyramine, which binds bile
acids, is effective in treating bile salt induced diarrhea.
Low fat diets or more easily digestible fat is useful in
some patients. New antidiarrheal drugs that decrease
excessive secretion of fluid by the intestinal tract is
another approach for some diseases. Avoidance of med-
ications or other products that are known to cause diar-
rhea (such as lactose) is curative in some, but should be
discussed with a physician.

Encephalitis symptoms may last several weeks.
Most cases of encephalitis are mild, and recovery is usu-
ally quick. Mild encephalitis usually leaves no residual
neurological problems. Overall, approximately 10% of
those with encephalitis die from their infections or com-
plications such as secondary infection. Some forms of
encephalitis have more severe courses, including herpes
encephalitis, in which mortality is 15–20% with treat-
ment, and 70–80% without. Antiviral treatment is inef-
fective for eastern equine encephalitis, and mortality is
approximately 30%.
Permanent neurological consequences may follow
recovery in some cases. Consequences may include per-
sonality changes, memory loss, language difficulties,
seizures, and partial paralysis.

refers to a mild viral infection of the larynx. Croup is also
known as laryngotracheitis, a medical term that describes
the inflammation of the trachea (windpipe) and larynx.
Parainfluenza viruses are the typical root cause of
the infection, but influenza (flu) and cold viruses may
sometimes be responsible. All of these viruses are highly
contagious and easily transmitted between individuals
via sneezing and coughing. Children between the ages of
three months and six years are usually affected, with the
greatest incidence at one to two years of age. Croup can
occur at any time of the year, but it is most typical during
early autumn and winter. The characteristic harsh bark-
ing of a croupy cough can be very distressing, but it
rarely indicates a serious problem. Most children with
croup can be treated very effectively at home; however,
1â€“5% may require medical treatment.
Croup may sometimes be confused with more seri-
ous conditions, such as epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis.
These ailments arise from bacterial infection and must
receive medical treatment.

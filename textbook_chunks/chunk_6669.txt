Imaging tests such as computed tomography scans
(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are only
used to look at the pituitary and adrenal glands after a
firm diagnosis has already been made. The presence of a
pituitary or adrenal tumor does not necessarily guarantee
that it is the source of increased ACTH production. Many
healthy people with no symptoms or disease whatsoever
have noncancerous tumors in the pituitary and adrenal
glands. Thus, CT and MRI is often used to image the
pituitary and adrenal glands in preparation for surgery.

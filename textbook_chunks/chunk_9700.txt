Most children born with trisomy 18 die within their
first year of life. The average lifespan is less than two
months for 50% of the children, and 90–95% die before
their first birthday. The 5–10% of children who survive
their first year are severely mentally retarded. They need
support to walk, and learning is limited. Verbal commu-
nication is also limited, but they can learn to recognize
and interact with others.

No special precautions are needed for this test.
Patients with a history of bleeding disorder should con-
sult with their treating physician before the test. If a mus-
cle biopsy is planned as part of the diagnostic work-up,
EMG should not be performed at the same site, as it may
effect the microscopic appearance of the muscle.

An eye examination, given by an ophthalmologist or
optometrist, costs about $100. It may or may not be cov-
ered by insurance. It begins with information from the
patient (case history) and continues with a set of primary
tests, plus additional specialized tests given as needed, dic-
tated by the outcomes of initial testing and the patient’s
age. The primary tests can be divided into two groups,
those that evaluate the physical state of the eyes and sur-
rounding areas, and those that measure the ability to see.
The order of the tests for the exam may differ from
doctor to doctor, however, most exams will include the
following procedures:
Information gathering and initial observations
The examiner will take eye and medical histories that
include the patient’s chief complaint, any past eye disor-
ders, all medications being taken (e.g., OTC medications,
antibiotics, and birth control pills), any blood relatives
with eye disorders, and any systemic disorders the patient
may have. The patient should also tell the doctor about
hobbies and work conditions. This information helps in
modifying prescriptions and lets the doctor know how the
patient uses his or her eyes. For example, using a comput-
er screen vs. construction work, the working distance of a
computer screen may affect the prescription; the con-
struction worker needs protective eyewear.
The patient should bring their current pair of glasses
to the exam. The doctor can get the prescription from the
glasses by using an instrument called a lensometer.

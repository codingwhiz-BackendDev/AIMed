the center of the surface and signals whenever he or she
detects a flash of light. The perimeter records which
flashes are seen and which are missed and maps the
patientâ€™s field of vision and blindspots.
Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement
Tonometers are used to measure IOP. Some tonome-
ters measure pressure by expelling a puff of air (noncon-
tact tonometer) towards the eyeball from a very short dis-
tance. Other tonometers are placed directly on the cornea.
The noncontact tonometers are not as accurate as the con-
tact tonometers and are sometimes used for screenings.
Completing the evaluation with additional tests
Depending upon the results other tests may be
necessary. These can include, but are not limited to

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is a laboratory
test to examine a sample of the fluid surrounding the
brain and spinal cord. This fluid is a clear, watery liquid
that protects the central nervous system from injury and
cushions it from the surrounding bone structure. It con-
tains a variety of substances, particularly glucose (sugar),
protein, and white blood cells from the immune system.
The fluid is withdrawn through a needle in a procedure
called a lumbar puncture.

Carotid artery—Two main arteries (passageway
carrying blood from the heart to other parts of the
body) that carry blood to the brain.
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia—The profusion
of part of the stomach through an opening in the
diaphragm.
Meconium aspiration syndrome—Breathing in of
meconium (a newborn’s first stool) by a fetus or
newborn, which can block air passages and inter-
fere with lung expansion.
Membrane oxygenator—The artificial lung that
adds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide.
Pulmonary hypertension—A disorder in which the
blood pressure in the arteries supplying the lungs
is abnormally high.
Respiratory distress syndrome—A lung disorder
usually of premature infants that causes increasing
difficulty in breathing, leading to a life-threatening
deficiency of oxygen in the blood.
Venoarterial (V-A) bypass—The type of ECMO
that provides both heart and lung support, using
two tubes (one in the jugular vein and one in the
carotid artery).
Venovenous (V-V) bypass—The type of ECMO that
provides lung support only, using a tube inserted
into the jugular vein.
There is a small chance that some part of the com-
plex equipment may fail, which could introduce air into
the system or affect the patient’s blood levels, causing
damage or death of vital organs (including the brain).
For this reason, the ECMO circuit is constantly moni-
tored by a trained technologist.

D & C is commonly used to obtain tissue for micro-
scopic evaluation to rule out cancer. D & C may also be
used to diagnose and treat heavy menstrual bleeding, and
to diagnose endometrial polyps and uterine fibroids. A
D & C can be used as a treatment as well, to remove
pregnancy tissue after a miscarriage, incomplete abor-
tion, or childbirth. Endometrial polyps may be removed,
and sometimes benign uterine tumors (fibroids) may be
scraped away. D & C can also be used as an early abor-
tion technique up to 16 weeks.

Congenital brain defects are diagnosed either from
direct physical examination or imaging studies including
computed tomography scans (CT) and magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) scans. Electroencephalography
(EEG) may be used to reveal characteristic abnormalities.
Prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects causing
anencephaly or meningomyelocele is possible through
ultrasound examination and maternal blood testing for
alpha-fetoprotein, which is almost always elevated.
Ultrasound can also be used to diagnose Dandy-Walker
and Chiari II malformations. Amniocentesis may reveal
trisomies or other chromosomal abnormalities.

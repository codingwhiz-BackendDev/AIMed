When an individual is involved in strenuous
sports or heavy work, involved joints may be protect-
ed by elastic bandage wraps, tape wraps, knee and
shoulder pads, or special support stockings. Keeping
the muscles surrounding the joint strong will also
help prevent dislocations. Long-term problems may
also be prevented by allowing an adequate amount of
time for an injured joint to rest and heal prior to
resuming full activity.

the septum, accomplished by breaking it loose and fixing
it in a proper place while it heals. Decongestants like
pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine will shrink the
membranes and thereby enlarge the passages. Antihista-
mines, nasal cortisone spray, and other allergy treat-
ments may also be temporarily beneficial.

In chronic bronchitis, chronic inflammation caused
by cigarette smoking results in a narrowing of the open-
ings in the bronchi, the large air tubes of the respiratory
system, and interferes with the flow of air. Inflammation
also causes the glands that line the bronchi to produce
excessive amounts of mucus, further narrowing the air-
ways and blocking airflow. The result is often a chronic
cough that produces sputum (mainly mucus) and short-
ness of breath. Cigarette smoke also damages the cilia,
small hair-like projections that move bacteria and foreign
particles out of the lungs, increasing the risk of infections.

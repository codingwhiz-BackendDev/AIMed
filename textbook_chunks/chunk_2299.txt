Since cervical spondylosis is part of the normal
aging process, not much can be done to prevent it. It may
be possible to ward off some or all of the symptoms by
engaging in regular physical exercise and limiting occu-
pational or recreational activities that place pressure on
the head, neck, and shoulders. The best exercises for the
health of the cervical spine are noncontact activities,
such as swimming, walking, or yoga. Once symptoms
have already developed, the emphasis is on symptom
management rather than prevention.

Treatment of diabetic neuropathy is usually focused
on treating the symptoms associated with the neuropathy
and addressing the underlying cause by improving the
control of blood sugar levels, which may heal the early
stages of neuropathy.
There is no cure for the permanent nerve damage
caused by neuropathy. To help control pain, the choice of
proven drug therapies has broadened during the past
decade. Pain medication, such as the topical skin cream
capsaicin, is usually no stronger than codeine because of
the potential for addiction with long-term use of such
drugs. Four main classes of drugs are available for pain
management, alone or in combination: tricyclic antide-
pressants (Imipramine, Nortriptyline), narcotic anal-
gesics (Morphine), anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine,
Gabapentin), and antiarrhythmics.

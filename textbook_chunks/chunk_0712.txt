Campylobacteriosis refers to infection by the group
of bacteria known as Campylobacter. The term comes
from the Greek word meaning “curved rod” referring to
the bacteria’s curved shape. The most common disease
caused by these organisms is diarrhea, which most often
affects children and younger adults. Campylobacter
infections account for a substantial percent of food-borne
illness encountered each year.

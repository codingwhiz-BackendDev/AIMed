Amyloid—Amyloid protein resembles a starch and
is deposited in tissues during the course of certain
chronic diseases.
Ataxia—Problems with coordination and walking.
Autosomal dominant—A form of inheritance in
which only one copy of a gene coding for a dis-
ease need be present for that disease to be
expressed. If either parent has the disease, a child
has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.
Chromosome—A cellular structure containing
genetic information in the form of DNA.
Dementia—Loss of memory and other higher
functions, such as thinking or speech, lasting six
months or more.
Hemorrhage—Bleeding, or escape of blood
through ruptured or unruptured blood vessel walls.
Lobar hemorrhage—Bleeding into one of the
lobes of the brain.
Seizure—Epileptic convulsion, fit, or attack.
Sporadic—A form of disease found in persons
without a family history of the disease.
Spasticity—Limb stiffness related to disease of the
brain or spinal cord.
Stroke—Sudden neurological deficit related to
impaired blood supply to the brain.
hemorrhage. Petechial hemorrhages (tiny hemorrhages
involving many small vessels) may produce recurrent,
brief neurologic symptoms secondary to seizures or
decreased blood flow, or may produce rapidly progres-
sive dementia (loss of memory and other brain functions)
that worsens in distinct steps rather than gradually. Over
40% of patients with hemorrhage secondary to CAA also
have dementia.
Genetic factors play a role in certain types of CAA
and in diseases associated with CAA:
• Dutch type of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with
amyloidosis (build up of amyloid protein in blood ves-
sels): autosomal dominant, with a genetic mutation
involving the amyloid precursor protein. Onset is at age
40–60 with headaches, brain hemorrhage often in the
parietal lobe, strokes, and dementia. More than half of
patients die from their first hemorrhage. Patients with
the Dutch type of CAA may produce an abnormal anti-

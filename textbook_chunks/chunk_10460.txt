If left untreated, infective endocarditis continues to
progress and is always fatal. However, if it is diagnosed
and properly treated within the first six weeks of infec-
tion, the infection can be completely cured in about 90%
of the cases. The prognosis depends on a number of fac-
tors, such as the patientâ€™s age and overall physical condi-
tion, the severity of the diseases involved, the exact site
of the infection, how vulnerable the microorganisms are
to antibiotics, and what kind of complications the endo-
carditis may be causing.

Enzymes are protein molecules used by the body to
perform all of its chemical actions and reactions. The
body manufactures several thousands of enzymes.
Among them are the digestive enzymes produced by the
stomach, pancreas, small intestine, and the salivary
glands of the mouth. Their energy-producing properties
are responsible for not only the digestion of nutrients, but
their absorption, transportation, metabolization, and
elimination as well.
Enzyme therapy is based on the work of Dr. Edward
Howell in the 1920s and 1930s. Howell proposed that
enzymes from foods work in the stomach to pre-digest
food. He advocated the consumption of large amounts of
plant enzymes, theorizing that if the body had to use less
of its own enzymes for digestion, it could store them for
maintaining metabolic harmony. Four categories of plant
enzymes are helpful in pre-digestion: protease, amylase,
lipase, and cellulase. Cellulase is particularly helpful
because the body is unable to produce it.
Animal enzymes, such as pepsin extracted from the
stomach of pigs, work more effectively in the duodenum.
They are typically used for the treatment of nondigestive
ailments.

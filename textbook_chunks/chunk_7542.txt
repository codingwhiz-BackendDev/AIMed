Absence of exposure to TB is indicated by absent or
very little skin reaction; redness or hardness smaller than
5 mm (about 0.25 in) is considered normal for a person
not exposed or infected with TB.
Patch test sites should be normal or only slightly red.
T cell responsiveness tests should be positive; that is,
the injected areas should be reddened and hard. Two affect-
ed areas of 2 mm or more is considered a positive result.

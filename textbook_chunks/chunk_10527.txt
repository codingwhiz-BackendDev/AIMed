and takes about an hour. The patient may be given general
anesthesia. The doctor dilates the cervix and uses a spe-
cial instrument to scrape tissue from inside the uterus.
The tissue that is obtained from the biopsy or the D &
C is sent to a laboratory for examination. If cancer is found,
then the type of cancer will be determined. The treatment
and prognosis depends on the type and stage of the cancer.
Trans-vaginal ultrasound may be used to measure the
thickness of the endometrium. For this painless procedure,
a wand-like ultrasound transducer is inserted into the vagi-
na to enable visualization and measurement of the uterus,
the thickness of the uterine lining, and other pelvic organs.
Other possible diagnostic procedures include sono-
hysterography and hysteroscopy. For sonohysteroscopy,
a small tube is passed through the cervix and into the
uterus. A small amount of a salt water (saline) solution is
injected through the tube to open the space within the
uterus and allow ultrasound visualization of the
endometrium. For hysteroscopy, a wand-like camera is
passed through the cervix to allow direct visualization of
the endometrium. Both of these procedures cause dis-
comfort, which may be reduced by taking an anti-inflam-
matory medication prior to the procedure.

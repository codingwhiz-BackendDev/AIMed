Exophthalmos is obvious when it is advanced
enough to cause complications. When there is doubt in
the early stages, a mechanical device called an exoph-
thalmometer can measure the protrusion. Computed
tomography scans (CT scans) are of great value in
examining the bony components of the orbit. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scanning is equally valuable
for displaying the contents of the orbit, because it “sees
through” the bone.

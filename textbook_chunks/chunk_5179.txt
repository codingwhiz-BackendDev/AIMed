Nonsurgical treatments include exercise programs,
orthosis (a force system, often involving braces), and
medications. A physical therapist may develop a program
that includes strengthening, range-of-motion exercises,
pain control, and functional activities. Chiropractic
medicine may be helpful, especially the procedures of
closed manipulations, to reduce the dislocated hip joint.

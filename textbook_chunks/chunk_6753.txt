Cutis laxa is extremely rare; less than a few hundred
cases worldwide have been described.
The several forms of cutis laxa are divided into pri-
mary cutis laxa, which is present from birth and is hered-
itary, secondary cutis laxa, which arises later in life and
may be either hereditary, and acquired cutis laxa, which
arises later in life and is not hereditary. Loose skin, the
primary and most obvious symptom of these diseases, is
caused by underlying defects in connective tissue struc-
ture, which also cause more serious internal problems in
vocal cords, bones, cartilage, blood vessels, bladder, kid-
ney, digestive system, and lungs. The loose skin is partic-
ularly obvious on the face, and children with the disorder
look sad or mournful.

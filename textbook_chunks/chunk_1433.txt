of arthritis and various injuries to the arm and wrist
(including fractures, sprains, and dislocations). Further-
more, activities which cause an individual to repeatedly
bend the wrist inward toward the forearm can predispose
to carpal tunnel syndrome. Certain jobs which require
repeated strong wrist motions carry a relatively high risk
of carpal tunnel syndrome. Injuries of this type are
referred to as “repetitive motion” injuries, and are more
frequent among secretaries doing a lot of typing, people
working at computer keyboards or cash registers, factory
workers, and some musicians.

CGD is an X-linked genetic disease, meaning the
defective gene is carried on the X chromosome (one
of the sex chromosomes). Females have two copies of
the X chromosome, whereas males have one X and
one Y. CGD also is a recessive defect meaning that
both copies of the chromosome must have the defect
before it can be expressed. Females who have one X
chromosome without the defect do not get this dis-
ease. Males, since they only have one X chromosome,
get the disease if the defect is present. Thus, CGD
affects mostly males.
CGD is an immunodeficiency disorder. Patients
with immunodeficiency disorders suffer frequent infec-
tions. This happens because part of their immune system
isnâ€™t working properly and the infectious microorgan-
isms are not killed as rapidly as is normal. In CGD there
is a defect in the ability of the white blood cells to kill
bacteria and fungi. The white blood cells affected are
phagocytic cells. They are part of the non-specific
immune system and move via the blood to all parts of the
body where they ingest and destroy microbes. Phagocyt-
ic cells are the first line of defense against microorgan-
isms. In this disease, the decreased ability to kill
microbes that they have ingested leads to a failure to
effectively combat infectious diseases. Patients with
CGD are subject to certain types of recurring infection,
especially those of the skin, lungs, mouth, nose,
intestines, and lymph nodes. With the exception of the
lymph nodes, all of these areas are considered external
tissues that come into contact with microorganisms from
the environment. The lymph system drains all areas of
the body to eliminate destroyed microorganisms and to
assist the immune system in attacking microorganisms.
Infections occur in the lymph nodes as a consequence of
the normal draining function.

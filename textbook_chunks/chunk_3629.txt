There are alternate procedures for diagnosing genet-
ic and chromosomal disorders of the fetus. Amniocente-
sis is commonly used and involves inserting a needle
through the pregnant woman’s abdomen to obtain a sam-
ple of amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is usually per-
formed in the second trimester at approximately 16
weeks gestation and the laboratory analysis may take two
to three weeks. The two advantages of chorionic villus
sampling are that it is performed during the first trimester
and the results are available in about one week. However,
as of 1997, amniocentesis is being performed in the first
trimester, but this is still very rare. The risk of miscar-
riage after amniocentesis is 0.5–1% (one to two women
out of 200) which is lower than that for chorionic villus
sampling (1–3%).
A noninvasive alternative is the maternal blood test
called triple marker screening or multiple marker screen-
ing. A sample of the pregnant woman’s blood is analyzed
for three different markers: alphafetoprotein (AFP),
human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol.
The levels of these three markers in the mother’s blood
can identify unborn babies who are at risk for certain
genetic or chromosomal defects. This is a screening test
which determines the chance that the fetus has the defect,
but it can not diagnose defects. A negative test result
does not necessarily mean the unborn baby does not have
a birth defect. For instance, this screening test can only
predict 60–70% of the fetuses with Down syndrome.

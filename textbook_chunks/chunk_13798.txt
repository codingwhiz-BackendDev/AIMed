Bronchoscope—An illuminated instrument that is
inserted into the airway to inspect and retrieve
objects from the bronchial tubes.
Conjunctiva—Mucous membranes around the
inner surface of the eyelid.
Cornea—The rounded, transparent portion of the
eye that covers the pupil and iris and lets light into
the interior
Endoscopy—The surgical use of long, thin instru-
ments that have both viewing and operating capa-
bilities.
Heimlich maneuver—An emergency procedure
for removing a foreign object lodged in the airway
that is preventing the person from breathing. To
perform the Heimlich maneuver on a conscious
adult, the rescuer stands behind the victim and
encircles his waist. The rescuer makes a fist with
one hand and places the other hand on top, posi-
tioned below the rib cage and above the waist.
The rescuer then applies pressure by a series of
upward and inward thrusts to force the foreign
object back up the victim’s trachea.
out by blowing into the mouth while holding the other
nostril closed. Skilled practitioners have removed peas
from the ears by tiny improvised corkscrews; marbles by
q-tips with super glue. Tweezers often work well, too.
Insects can be floated out of the ear by pouring warm
(not hot) mineral oil, olive oil, or baby oil into the ear
canal. Items that are lodged deep in the ear canal are
more difficult to remove because of the possibility of
damaging the ear drum. These require emergency treat-
ment from a qualified physician.

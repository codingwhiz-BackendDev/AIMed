Because addiction involves so many different factors,
prospects for individual addicts vary widely. However,
research has consistently shown that treatment can signifi-
cantly reduce both drug abuse and subsequent criminal
activity. The comprehensive Services Research Outcomes
Study (1998) found a 45% drop in cocaine use five years
after treatment, compared to use during the five years before
treatment. The study also found that females generally
respond better to treatment than males, and older patients
tend to reduce their drug use more than younger patients.

Liver and lung fluke infections are treated with med-
ications. These include triclabendazole, praziquantel,
bithionol, albendazole, and mebendazole. Praziquantel
works by paralyzing the flukes’ suckers, forcing them to
drop away from the walls of the host’s blood vessels. In
the United States, bithionol is available only from the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Depending on the
species of fluke and the severity of infection, the course
of treatment can vary from several days to several weeks.
Cure rates vary from 50–95%. Most patients experience
mild temporary side effects from these drugs, including
diarrhea, dizziness, or headache.

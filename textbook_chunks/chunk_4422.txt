Latent—A nonactive virus which is in a dormant
state within a cell. The herpes virus is latent in the
nervous system.
Prodrome—The Symptoms that warn of the begin-
ning of disease. The herpes prodrome consists of
pain, burning, tingling, or itching at a site before
blisters are visible.
Recurrence—The return of an active infection fol-
lowing a period of latency.
Several practices can reduce the occurrence of cold
sores and the spread of virus to other body locations or
people. These practices are:
• Avoidance of sun exposure to the face. Before getting
prolonged exposure to the sun, apply sunscreen to the
face and especially to the lips. Wearing a hat with a
large brim is also helpful.
• Avoid touching cold sores. Squeezing, picking, or
pinching blisters can allow the virus to spread to other
parts of the lips or face and infect those sites.
• Wash hands frequently. Persons with oral herpes should
wash their hands carefully before touching others. An
infected person can spread the virus to others even
when he or she has no obvious blisters.
• Avoid contact with others during active infection.
Infected persons should avoid kissing or sexual contact
with others until after the cold sores have healed.
• Wear gloves when applying ointment to a child’s sore.
• Be especially careful with infants. Never kiss the eyes
or lips of a baby who is under six months old.
• Be watchful of infected children. Do not allow infected
children to share toys that may be put into the mouth.
Toys that have been mouthed should be disinfected
before other children play with them.
• Maintain good general health. A healthy diet, plenty of
sleep, and exercise help to minimize the chance of get-
ting a cold or the flu, which are known to bring on cold
sores. Also, good general health keeps the immune sys-
tem strong; this helps to keep the virus in check and
prevents outbreaks.

The CEA test is not a screening test for cancer. It is
not useful for detecting the presence of cancer. Many
cancers do not produce an increased CEA level. Some
noncancerous diseases, such as hepatitis, inflammatory
bowel disease, pancreatitis, and obstructive pulmonary
disease, may cause an elevated CEA level.

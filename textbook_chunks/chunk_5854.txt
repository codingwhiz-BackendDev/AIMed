around a little bit. Before being released from the hospi-
tal, the patient usually spends a few days under observa-
tion in a non-surgical unit. During this time, counseling is
usually provided on eating right and starting a light exer-
cise program to keep the heart healthy. Patients should eat
a lot of fruits, vegetables, grains, and non-fat or low-fat
dairy products, and reduce fats to less than 30% of all
calories. An exercise program will usually be tailored for
the patient, who will be encouraged to participate in a
cardiac rehabilitation program where exercise will be
supervised by professionals. Cardiac rehabilitation pro-
grams, offered by hospitals and other organizations, may
also include classes on heart-healthy living.
Full recovery from coronary artery bypass graft
surgery takes three to four months and is a gradual
process. Upon release from the hospital, the patient will
feel weak because of the extended bed rest in the hospi-
tal. Within a few weeks, the patient should begin to feel
stronger.
While the incision scar from coronary artery bypass
graft surgery heals, which takes one to two months, it
may be sore. The scar should not be bumped, scratched,
or otherwise disturbed. An exercise test is often conduct-
ed after the patient leaves the hospital to determine how
effective the surgery was and to confirm that progressive
exercise is safe.

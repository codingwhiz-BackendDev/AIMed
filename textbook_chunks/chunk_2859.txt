Child abuse was once viewed as a minor social prob-
lem affecting only a handful of United States children.
However, in recent years it has received close attention from
the media, law enforcement, and the helping professions,
and with increased public and professional awareness has
come a sharp rise in the number of reported cases. But
because abuse is often hidden from view and its victims too
young or fearful to speak out, experts suggest that its true
prevalence is possibly much greater than the official data
indicate. In 1996, more than three million victims of alleged
abuse were reported to child protective services (CPS) agen-
cies in the United States, and the reports were substantiated
in more than one million cases. Put another way, 1.5% of
the country’s children were confirmed victims of abuse in
1996. Parents were the abusers in 77% of the confirmed
cases, other relatives in 11%. Sexual abuse was more likely
to be committed by males, whereas females were responsi-
ble for the majority of neglect cases. More than 1,000 Unit-
ed States children died from abuse in 1996.
Although experts are quick to point out that abuse
occurs among all social, ethnic, and income groups,
reported cases usually involve poor families with little
education. Young mothers, single-parent families, and
parental alcohol or drug abuse are also common in report-
ed cases. Charles F. Johnson remarks, “More than 90% of
abusing parents have neither psychotic nor criminal per-
sonalities. Rather they tend to be lonely, unhappy, angry,
young, and single parents who do not plan their pregnan-
cies, have little or no knowledge of child development, and
have unrealistic expectations for child behavior.” About
10%, or perhaps as many as 40%, of abusive parents were
themselves physically abused as children, but most abused
children do not grow up to be abusive parents.

A corneal ulcer needs to be treated aggressively, as it
can result in loss of vision. The first step is to eliminate
infection. Broad spectrum antibiotics will be used
before the lab results come back. Medications may then
be changed to more specifically target the cause of the
infection. A combination of medications may be neces-
sary. Patients should return for their follow-up visits so
that the doctor can monitor the healing process. The
cornea can heal from many insults, but if it remains
scarred, corneal transplantation may be necessary to
restore vision. If the corneal ulcer is large, hospitaliza-
tion may be necessary.

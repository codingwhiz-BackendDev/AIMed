Home treatment is the usual method of managing
croup symptoms. It is important that the child is kept
comfortable and calm to the best degree possible, because
crying can make symptoms seem worse. Humid air can
help a child with croup feel more comfortable. Recom-
mended methods include sitting in a steamy bathroom
with the hot water running or using a cool-water vaporizer
or humidifier. Breathing may also be eased by going out-
side into cooler air. The child should drink frequently in
order to stay well hydrated. To treat any fever, the child
may be given an appropriate dose of acetaminophen
(like Tylenol). Antihistamines and decongestants are
ineffective in treating croup. Children under the age of 18
should not be given aspirin, as it may cause Reye’s syn-
drome, a life-threatening disease of the brain.
If the child does not respond to home treatment,
medical treatment at a doctor’s office or an emergency
room could be necessary. Based on the severity of symp-
toms and the response to treatment, the child may need to
be admitted to a hospital.
For immediate symptom relief, epinephrine may be
administered as an inhaled aerosol. Effects last for up to
two hours, but there is a possibility that symptoms may
return. For that reason, the child is kept under supervi-
sion for three or more hours. Another effective drug is a
glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. This drug requires more
time to take effect, but is longer lasting. It can be admin-
istered orally or as an injection. Another glucocorticoid,
budesonide, has been used outside the United States for
treating croup. It is administered as an inhaled aerosol
and has been shown to be effective; however, it is not
available as a treatment option in the United States.
Of the 1–5% of children requiring medical treat-
ment, approximately 1% need respiratory support. Such
support involves intubation (inserting a tube into the tra-
chea) and oxygen administration.

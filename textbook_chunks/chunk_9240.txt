Diagnosis of any menstrual irregularity begins with
the patient herself. The doctor will ask for a detailed
description of the problem, and take a history of how
long it has existed, and any patterns the patient has
observed. A woman can assist the doctor in diagnosing
the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding by keeping a
record of the time, frequency, length, and quantity of
bleeding. She should also tell the doctor about any ill-
nesses, including long-standing conditions, like diabetes
mellitus. The doctor will also inquire about sexual activ-
ity, use of contraceptives, current medications, and past
surgical procedures.

Anemia—A condition in which the hemoglobin
concentration in the blood is below normal.
Polycythemia vera—A condition characterized by
an unusually large number of red blood cells in
the blood due to increased production by the
bone marrow. Symptoms include headaches,
blurred vision, high blood pressure, dizziness, and
night sweats.
Secondary polycythemia—Secondary polycythe-
mia occurs when the excess of red blood cells is
caused by a condition other than polycythemia
vera. For example, when low levels of oxygen in the
blood stimulate the bone marrow to produce more
red blood cells, as in chronic lung disease.
cancer patients to prevent anemia (hemoglobin concen-
tration in the blood is lower than normal), or to treat ane-
mia that has been induced by chemotherapy and bone
marrow transplantation (BMT).
The correction of anemia can result in reduced
transfusion requirements, so the erythropoietin test is
used to diagnose anemia, including the anemia of end-
stage renal disease. Erythropoietin determination is also
valuable in diagnosing a condition known as poly-
cythemia, when increased numbers of red blood cells
occur. Levels of erythropoietin are extremely low in
polycythemia vera but are normal or high in secondary
polycythemia. It happens rarely, but cysts in the liver or
kidneys, as well as tumors in the kidneys or brain, can
also produce erythropoietin. Patients with these condi-
tions can have high levels of erythropoietin and may
develop secondary polycythemia.
Some athletes use EPO to enhance performance, as
the increased red cell volume adds more oxygen-carrying
capacity to the blood. Adverse reactions to this practice
can include clotting abnormalities, headache, seizures,
high blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash.

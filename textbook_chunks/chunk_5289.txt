The outlook for a patient with congestive cardiomy-
opathy depends on the severity of the disease and the
personâ€™s health. Generally, congestive cardiomyopathy
worsens over time and the prognosis is not good. About
50% of patients with congestive cardiomyopathy live for
five years after the diagnosis. Twenty five percent of
patients are alive 10 years after diagnosis. Women with
congestive cardiomyopathy live twice as long as men
with the disease. Many of the deaths are caused by sud-
den abnormal heart rhythms.

Only about 20% of patients with diverticulosis ever
have symptoms which lead them to seek medical help.
Most people never know that they have diverticula. For
those individuals who have cramping pain and constipa-
tion believed to be due to diverticulosis, the usual pre-
scription involves increasing the fiber in the diet. This
can be done by adding special diet supplements of bran
or psyllium seed, which increase stool volume. Bleeding
diverticula can usually be treated by bed rest, with blood
transfusion needed for more severe bleeding (hemor-
rhaging). In cases of very heavy hemorrhaging, medica-
tions which encourage clotting can be injected during the
course of a diagnostic angiography.
While there are almost no situations when uncom-
plicated diverticulosis requires surgery, giant diverticula
always require removal. This is due to the very high
chance of infection and perforation of these diverticula.
When giant diverticula are diagnosed, the usual treat-
ment involves removing that portion of the intestine.

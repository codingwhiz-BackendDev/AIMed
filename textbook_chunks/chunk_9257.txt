Alternative practitioners concentrate on good nutri-
tion as a way to prevent heavy periods that are not caused
by uterine fibroids, endometrial polyps, endometriosis, or
cancer. Iron supplementation (100 mg per day) not only
helps prevent anemia, but also appears to reduce menor-
rhagia in many women. Other recommended dietary sup-
plements include vitamins A and C. Vitamin C improves
capillary fragility and enhances iron uptake.
Vitamin E and bioflavonoid supplements are also
recommended. Vitamin E can help reduce blood flow,
and bioflavonoids help strengthen the capillaries. Vita-
min K is known to play a role in clotting and is helpful in
situations where heavy bleeding may be due to clotting
abnormalities
Botanical medicines used to assist in treating abnor-
mal bleeding include spotted cranesbill (Geranium macu-
latum), birthroot (Trillium pendulum), blue cohosh
(Caulophyllum thalictroides), witch hazel (Hamamelis
virginiana), shepherdâ€™s purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris),
and yarrow (Achillea millifolia). These are all stiptic
herbs that act to tighten blood vessels and tissue. Hor-
monal balance can also be addressed with herbal formula-
tions containing phytoestrogens and phytoprogesterone.

Irregular heartbeats can occur in healthy people
without causing any dangerous symptoms or requiring
medical attention. Slight changes in the normal patterns
of heartbeats often reset themselves without notice.
But when the heartbeat is greatly disrupted—either
because of traumatic injury, disease, hypertension,
surgery, or reduced blood flow to the heart caused by
blockages in the blood vessels that nourish the heart—
the condition must be recognized and treated immediate-
ly. Otherwise, it can be fatal.
Various drugs can be used to control and help reset
these abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). The tech-
nique of catheter ablation (meaning tube-guided removal)
is used to interrupt the abnormal contractions in the heart,
allowing normal heart beating to resume. Atrial fibrilla-
tion and flutter and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
are two of the most common disorders treated with
catheter ablation.

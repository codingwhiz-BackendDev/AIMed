Oral herpes can be painful and embarrassing, but it
is not a serious infection. There is no cure for oral herpes,
but outbreaks usually occur less frequently after age 35.
The spread of the herpes virus to the eyes is very serious.
The herpes virus can infect the cells in the cornea and
cause scarring that may impair vision.

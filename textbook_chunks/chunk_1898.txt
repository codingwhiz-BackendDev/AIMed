CAA may affect patients over age 45, but is most com-
mon in patients over age 65, and becomes more common
with increasing age. Men and women are equally affected.
In some cases, CAA is sporadic but it may also be inherited
as an autosomal dominant condition (a form of inheritance
in which only one copy of a gene coding for a disease need
be present for that disease to be expressed; if either parent
has the disease, a child has a 50% chance of inheriting the
disease). CAA is responsible for 5–20% of brain hemor-
rhages and up to 30% of lobar hemorrhages localized to one
lobe of the brain. CAA may be found during an autopsy in
over one-third of persons over age 60, even though they
may not have had brain hemorrhage, stroke, or other mani-
festations of the disease during life. In Alzheimer’s disease,
CAA is more common than in the general population, and
may occur in more than 80% of patients over age 60.

Cellulitis may be diagnosed and treated by a family
doctor, an infectious disease specialist, a doctor who spe-
cializes in skin diseases (dermatologist), or in the case of
orbital cellulitis, an eye doctor (ophthalmologist). The
diagnosis of cellulitis is based mainly on the patient’s
symptoms. The patient’s recent medical history is also
used in the diagnosis.
Laboratory tests may be done to determine which
kind of bacteria is causing the infection but these tests
are not always successful. If the skin injury is visible, a
sterile cotton swab is used to pick up a sample from the
wound. If there is no obvious skin injury, a needle may
be used to inject a small amount of sterile salt solution
into the infected skin, and then the solution is withdrawn.
The salt solution should pick up some of the bacteria
causing the infection. A blood sample may be taken from
the patient’s arm to see if bacteria have entered the
bloodstream. Also, a blood test may be done to count the
number of white blood cells in the blood. High numbers
of white blood cells suggest that the body is trying to
fight a bacterial infection.
For orbital cellulitis, the doctor may often perform a
special x-ray scan called computed tomography scan
(CT). This scan enables the doctor to see the patient’s
head in cross-section to determine exactly where the
infection is and see if any damage has occurred. A CT
scan takes about 20 minutes.

The major complication seen following face lift
surgery is a hematoma. If a hematoma forms, the patient
may have to return to have the stitches reopened to find
the source of the bleeding. Most hematomas form within
48 hours of surgery. The typical sign is pain or swelling
affecting one side of the face but not the other.
Another risk of face lift surgery is nerve damage.
Sometimes it can affect the patient’s ability to raise an
eyebrow, or distort his smile, or leave him with limited
feeling in his earlobe. Most of these nerve injuries, how-
ever, repair themselves within 2–6 months.

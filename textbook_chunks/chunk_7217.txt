Dacryocystitis usually occurs in only one eye. As
mentioned, the symptoms can range from watery eyes,
pain, swelling, and redness to a discharge of pus when
pressure is applied to the area between the bridge of the
nose and the inner eyelids. A sample of the pus may be
collected on a swab or in a tube for laboratory analysis.
The type of antibiotic and treatment may depend on
which bacteria is present. In the acute form, a blood test
may reveal an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count;
with a chronic infection, the WBC count is usually nor-
mal. To identify the exact location of the blockage, an x
ray can be taken after a dye is injected into the duct in a
procedure called dacryocystography.

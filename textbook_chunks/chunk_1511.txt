Proper post-operative care is especially important after
cataract surgery. Patients will need someone to drive them
home after the surgery and should not bend over or do any-
thing strenuous for about two weeks. They should refrain
from rubbing the eye, should wear glasses to protect their
eye, and should wear a shield while sleeping so the eye
wonâ€™t be rubbed or bumped accidentally. The patient will
usually continue their antibiotic for two to three weeks and
will also take anti-inflammatory medication for about the
same length of time. If the patient experiences inflamma-
tion, redness, or pain, they should seek immediate medical
treatment to avoid serious complications.

Genes from a small blood or tissue sample are analyzed
for specific mutations; presence of two copies of the
mutated gene confirms the diagnosis of CF in all but a
very few cases. However, since there are so many differ-
ent possible mutations, and since testing for all of them
would be too expensive and time-consuming, a negative
gene test cannot rule out the possibility of CF.
Couples planning a family may decide to have them-
selves tested if one or both have a family history of CF.
Prenatal genetic testing is possible through amniocente-
sis. Many couples who already have one child with CF
decide to undergo prenatal screening in subsequent preg-
nancies, and use the results to determine whether to ter-
minate the pregnancy. Siblings in these families are also
usually tested, both to determine if they will develop CF,
and to determine if they are carriers, to aid in their own
family planning. If the sibling has no symptoms, deter-
mining his carrier status is often delayed until his teen
years or later, when he is closer to needing the informa-
tion to make decisions.

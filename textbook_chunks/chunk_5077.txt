Successful treatment of a child with congenital
amputation involves an entire medical team, including a
pediatrician, an orthopedist, a psychiatrist or psycholo-
gist, a prosthetist (an expert in making prosthetics, or
artificial limbs), a social worker, and occupational and
physical therapists. The accepted method of treatment is
to fit the child early with a functional prosthesis because
this leads to normal development and less wasting away
(atrophy) of the muscles of the limbs present. However,
some parents and physicians believe that the child should
be allowed to learn to play and perform tasks without a
prosthesis, if possible. When the child is older, he or she
can be involved in the decision of whether or not to be
fitted for a prosthesis.
Recently, there have been cases in which physicians
have detected amniotic band constriction interfering with
limb development fairly early in its course. In 1997, doc-
tors at the Florida Institute for Fetal Diagnosis and Ther-
apy reported two cases in which minimally invasive
surgery freed constricting amniotic bands and preserved
the affected limbs.

Medication that causes scarring can be injected
directly into veins to control bleeding from varices in the
stomach or esophagus. Varices may require a special sur-
gical procedure called balloon tamponade ligation to stop
the bleeding. Surgery may be required to repair disease-
related throat damage. It is sometimes necessary to
remove diseased portions of the spleen and other organs.
Liver transplants can benefit patients with advanced
cirrhosis. However, the new liver will eventually become
diseased unless the underlying cause of cirrhosis is
removed. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis must demon-
strate a willingness to stop drinking before being consid-
ered suitable transplant candidates.

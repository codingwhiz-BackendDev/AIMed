Dialysis treatment replaces the function of the kid-
neys, which normally serve as the bodyâ€™s natural filtra-
tion system. Through the use of a blood filter and a
chemical solution known as dialysate, the treatment
removes waste products and excess fluids from the
bloodstream, while maintaining the proper chemical bal-
ance of the blood. There are two types of dialysis treat-
ment : hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

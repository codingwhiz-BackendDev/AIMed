with Down syndrome has the type that results from a
translocation, it is possible that one of the two parents is
a carrier of that defect. A carrier “carries” the genetic
defect, but does not actually have the disorder. When
one parent is a carrier of a translocation, the chance of
future offspring having Down syndrome is greatly
increased. The specific risk will have to be calculated by
a genetic counselor.

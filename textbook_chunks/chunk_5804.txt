should begin as soon as an abnormality
appears. The first step is to identify and eliminate the
source of pressure. Placing moleskin pads over corns can
relieve pressure, and large wads of cotton, lambâ€™s wool,
or moleskin can cushion calluses.
Using hydrocortisone creams or soaking feet in a
solution of Epsom salts and very warm water for at least
five minutes a day before rubbing the area with a pumice
stone will remove part or all of some calluses. Rubbing
corns just makes them hurt more.
Applying petroleum jelly or lanolin-enriched hand
lotion helps keep skin soft, but corn-removing ointments
that contain acid can damage healthy skin. They should
never be used by pregnant women or by people who are
diabetic or who have poor circulation.

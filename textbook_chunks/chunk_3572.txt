embryo in the uterus. Most of these cancers form inside
the reproductive organs. Some originate in the testes or
ovaries, especially in young adults. Others develop in the
uterus after a pregnancy or miscarriage—particularly
often after a mole. A few choriocarcinomas arise in sites
outside the reproductive organs. Such “extragonadal”
tumors are usually found in young adults and are more
common in males.
Choriocarcinomas are one of the most dangerous
germ cell cancers. Choriocarcinomas usually grow
quickly and spread widely. Occasionally, this cancer
grows so fast that the original tumor outgrows its blood
supply and dies, leaving behind only a small scar.

The best method of preventing filariasis is to prevent
being repeatedly bitten by the mosquitoes that carry the
disease. Some methods of preventing insect bites include
the following:
• limit outdoor activities at night, particularly in rural or
jungle areas
• wear long sleeves and pants and avoid dark-colored
clothing that attracts mosquitoes
• avoid perfumes and colognes
• treat one or two sets of clothing ahead of time with per-
methrin (Duramon, Permanone)
• wear DEET insect repellent or, especially for children,
try citronella or lemon eucalyptus, to repel insects
• if sleeping in an open area or in a room with poor
screens, use a bed net to avoid being bitten while asleep
• use air conditioning, the cooler air makes insects less
active
In addition, filariasis can be controlled in highly infest-
ed areas by taking ivermectin preventatively before being
bitten. Currently, there is no vaccine available, but scien-
tists are working on a preventative vaccine at this time.

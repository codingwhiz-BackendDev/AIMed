Folliculitis develops when bacteria, such as Staphy-
lococcus, or a fungus enters the body through a cut,
scrape, surgical incision, or other break in the skin near a
hair follicle. Scratching the affected area can trap fungus
or bacteria under the fingernails and spread the infection
to hair follicles on other parts of the body.
The bacteria that cause folliculitis are contagious. A
person who has folliculitis can infect others who live in
the same household.
Factors that increase the risk of developing folliculi-
tis include:
• dermatitis
• diabetes
• dirty, crowded living conditions
• eczema
• exposure to hot, humid temperatures
• infection in the nose or other recent illness
• tight clothing

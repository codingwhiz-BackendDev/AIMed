Government efforts to prevent abuse include home-
visitor programs aimed at high-risk families and school-
based efforts to teach children how to respond to attempt-
ed sexual abuse. Emotional abuse prevention has been
promoted through the media.
When children reach age three, parents should begin
teaching them about “bad touches” and about confiding
in a suitable adult if they are touched or treated in a way
that makes them uneasy. Parents also need to exercise
caution in hiring babysitters and other caretakers. Any-
one who suspects abuse should immediately report those
suspicions to the police or his or her local CPS agency,
which will usually be listed in the blue pages of the tele-
phone book under Rehabilitative Services or Child and
Family Services, or in the yellow pages. Round-the-
clock crisis counseling for children and adults is offered
by the Childhelp USA/IOF Foresters National Child
Abuse Hotline. The National Committee to Prevent Child
Abuse is an excellent source of information on the many
support groups and other organizations that help abused
and at-risk children and their families. One of these orga-
nizations, National Parents Anonymous, sponsors 2,100
local self-help groups throughout the United States,
Canada, and Europe. Telephone numbers for its local
groups are listed in the white pages of the telephone book
under Parents Anonymous or can be obtained by calling
the national headquarters.

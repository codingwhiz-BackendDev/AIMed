Alternative treatments for cirrhosis are aimed at pro-
moting the function of healthy liver cells and relieving the
symptoms associated with the disease. Several herbal
remedies may be helpful to cirrhosis patients. Dandelion
(Taraxacum officinale) and rock-poppy (Chelidonium
majus) may help improve the efficiency of liver cells.
Milk thistle extract (Silybum marianum) may slow dis-
ease progression and significantly improve survival rates
in alcoholics and other cirrhosis patients. Practitioners of
homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine can also
prescribe treatments that support healthy liver function.

If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and
the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not
breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the
person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don’t
wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control
center immediately. Providing as much information as
possible to the poison control center can help determine
what the next course of action should be.
The poison control center, paramedics, and emer-
gency room staff will want to know:
• what drug(s) were taken—try to locate the drug’s con-
tainer.
• how much of the drug was taken
• when was the drug taken
• was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or
chemicals
• what is the age of the patient
• what symptoms are the patient experiencing
• is the patient conscious
• is the patient breathing
The poison control center may recommend trying to
get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup,
which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar-
macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom-
mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house-
holds with children. This medication should be used only
on the advice of a medical professional. Vomiting should
not be induced if the patient is unconscious.

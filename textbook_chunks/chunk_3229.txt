Although the laparoscopic procedure requires general
anesthesia for about the same length of time as the open
procedure, laparoscopy generally produces less postoper-
ative pain, and a shorter recovery period. The laparoscopic
procedure would not be preferred in cases where the gall-
bladder is so inflamed that it could rupture, or when adhe-
sions (additional fibrous bands of tissue) are present.

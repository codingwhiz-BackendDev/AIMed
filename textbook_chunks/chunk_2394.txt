The best way to diagnose acute infection is to identi-
fy the parasites in tissue or blood. Occasionally it is pos-
sible to culture the organism from infected tissue, but this
process usually requires too much time to be of value. In
the chronic phase, antibody levels can be measured.
Efforts to develop new, more accurate tests are ongoing.

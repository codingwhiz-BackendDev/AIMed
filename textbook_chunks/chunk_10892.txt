The disease can be prevented by treating all the
infected cases and thus eliminating the source of infec-
tion. Some ways to keep from catching or spreading the
disease include the following recommendations:
• wash hands thoroughly before handling food and eating
• keep finger nails short and clean
• avoiding scratching the anal area
• take early morning showers to wash away eggs deposit-
ed overnight
• once the infection has been identified, and treatment is
started, change the bed linen, night clothes, and under-
wear daily
• machine wash linens in hot water and dry with heat to
kill any eggs
• open the blinds or curtains since eggs are sensitive to
sunlight

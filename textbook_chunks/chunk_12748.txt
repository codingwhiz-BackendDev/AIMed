FGM results in the cutting or removal of the tissues
around the vagina that give women pleasurable sexual
feelings. This procedure is used for social and cultural
control of women’s sexuality. In its most extreme form,
infibulation, where the girl’s vagina is sewn shut, the pro-
cedure ensures virginity. In some cultures where female
circumcision has been a tradition for hundreds of years,
this procedure is considered a rite of passage for young
girls. Families fear that if their daughters are left uncir-
cumcised, they may not be marriageable. As in most cul-
tures, there is also the fear that the girl might bring
shame to the family by being sexually active and becom-
ing pregnant before marriage.

betamethasone, trimacinolone, and others. Glucocorti-
coids are formulated in oral dosage forms, topical creams
and ointments, oral and nasal inhalations, rectal foams,
and ear and eye drops.
Mineralocorticoids control the retention of sodium
in the kidneys. In mineralocorticoid deficiency, there is
excessive loss of sodium through the kidneys, with
resulting water loss. Fludrocortisone (Florinef) is the
only drug available for treatment of mineralocorticoid
deficiency, and is available only in an oral dosage form.
Corticotropin (ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone)
stimulates the pituitary gland to release cortisone. A defi-
ciency of corticotropic hormone will have the same effects
as a deficiency of cortisone. The hormone, which is avail-
able under the brand names Acthar and Actrel, is used for
diagnostic testing, to determine the cause of a glucocorti-
coid deficiency, but is rarely used for replacement therapy
since direct administration of glucocorticoids may be easi-
er and offers better control over dosages.

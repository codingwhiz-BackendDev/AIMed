Hormonal therapies effectively tame endometriosis
but also act as contraceptives. A woman who is hoping to
become pregnant would take these medications for a
period of time, then try to conceive within several
months of discontinuing treatment.
• Oral contraceptives. Continuously taking estrogen-
progestin pills tricks the body into thinking it is preg-
nant. This state of pseudopregnancy means reduced
pelvic pain and a temporary withering of endometrial
implants.
• Danazol (Danocrine) and gestrinone are synthetic male
hormones that lower estrogen levels, prevent menstrua-
tion, and shrink endometrial tissues. On the downside,
they lead to weight gain and menopause-like symp-
toms, and cause some women to develop masculine
characteristics.
• Progestins. Medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) and
related drugs may also be used in treating endometrio-
sis. They have been proven effective in minimizing pain
and halting the progress of the condition, but are rarely
used because of the high rate of side effects.
• Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnHR) agonists.
These estrogen-inhibiting drugs successfully limit pain
and prevent the growth of endometrial implants. They
can cause menopause symptoms, however, and doses
have to be regulated to prevent bone loss associated
with low estrogen levels.

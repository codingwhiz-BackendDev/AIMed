This infant has an unilateral cleft lip and palate. (Custom

Depending of the type of cleft palate, more than one oper-
ation may be needed to close the cleft and improve speech.
Nonsurgical treatment of a cleft palate is available for
patients who are at high risk for surgery and consists of a
prosthetic appliance worn to block the opening in the palate.
Babies born with cleft palates are vulnerable to ear
infections. Their Eustachian tubes do not effectively
drain fluid from the middle ear so fluid accumulates and
infection sets in. This may lead to hearing loss. These
children require drainage tubes to be inserted to prevent
fluid accumulation.
Babies born with clefts usually require orthodontic
treatment between 13 and 18 years of age. They also
require speech therapy.

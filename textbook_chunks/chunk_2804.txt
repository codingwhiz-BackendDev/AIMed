Congestive heart failure and other cardiac diseases
may be indicated on the view of a heart and lung in a
chest radiograph. Fractures of the sternum and ribs are
usually easily detected as breaks on the chest x ray. In
some instances, the radiologistâ€™s view of the diaphragm
may indicate an abdominal problem. Tuberculosis can
also be indicated by elevation of the diaphragm. Foreign
bodies which may have been swallowed or inhaled can
usually be located by the radiologist as they will look dif-
ferent from any other tissue or structure in the chest. Ser-
ial chest x rays may be ordered to track changes over a
period of time.

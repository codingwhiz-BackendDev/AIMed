Elective cardioversion is usually scheduled ahead of
time. After arriving at the hospital, an intravenous (IV)
catheter will be placed in the arm and oxygen will be
given through a face mask. A short-acting general anes-
thetic will be administered through the vein. During the
two or three minutes of anesthesia, the doctor will apply
two paddles to the exterior of the chest and administer
the electric shock. It may be necessary to give the shock
two or three times to obtain normal rhythm.

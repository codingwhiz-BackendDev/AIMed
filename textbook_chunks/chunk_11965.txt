The examiner asks the patient to look up and down,
and to the right and left to see if the patient can move the
eyes to their full extent. The examiner asks the patient to
stare at an object, then quickly covers one eye and notes
any movement in the eye that remains uncovered. This
procedure is repeated with the other eye. This, and anoth-
er similar cover test, helps to determine if there is an
undetected eye turn or problem with fixation. The doctor
may also have the patient look at a pen and follow it as it
is moved close to the eyes. This checks convergence.

Alternative practitioners suggest several kinds of
treatment to speed recovery from frostbite after leaving the
hospital. Bathing the affected part in warm water or using
contrast hydrotherapy can help enhance circulation. Con-
trast hydrotherapy involves a series of hot and cold water
applications. A hot compress (as hot as the patient can
stand) is applied to the affected area for three minutes fol-
lowed by an ice cold compress for 30 seconds. These
applications are repeated three times each, ending with the
cold compress. Nutritional therapy to promote tissue
growth in damaged areas may also be helpful. Homeo-
pathic and botanical therapies may also assist recovery
from frostbite. Homeopathic Hypericum (Hypericum per-
foratum) is recommended when nerve ending are affected
(especially in the fingers and toes) and Arnica (Arnica
montana) is prescribed for shock. Cayenne pepper (Cap-
sicum frutescens) can enhance circulation and relieve pain.
Drinking hot ginger (Zingiber officinale) tea also aids cir-
culation. Other possible approaches include acupuncture
to avoid permanent nerve damage and oxygen therapy.

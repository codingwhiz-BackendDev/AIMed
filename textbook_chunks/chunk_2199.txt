Cervical conization is performed if the results of a
cervical biopsy have found a precancerous condition in the
cervix. The cervix is the small cylindrical organ at the
lower part of the uterus, which separates the uterus from
the vagina. Cervical conization also may be performed if
there is an abnormal cervical smear test (PAP test). A
biopsy is a diagnostic test in which tissue or cells are
removed from the body and examined under a microscope,
primarily to look for cancer or other abnormalities.

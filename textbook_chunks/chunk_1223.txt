While cardiac catheterization may be performed on
an outpatient basis, a patient may require close monitor-
ing following the procedure while remaining in the hos-
pital for at least 24 hours. The patient will be instructed
to rest in bed for at least eight hours immediately after
the test. If the catheter was inserted into a vein or artery
in the leg or groin area, the leg will be kept extended for
four to six hours. If a vein or artery in the arm was used
to insert the catheter, the arm will need to remain extend-
ed for a minimum of three hours.
The patient should expect a hard ridge to form over
the incision site that diminishes as the site heals. Bluish
discoloration under the skin at the point of insertion
should also be expected but fades in two weeks. It is also
not uncommon for the incision site to bleed during the
first 24 hours following surgery. If this should happen,
the patient should apply pressure to the site with a clean
tissue or cloth for 10â€“15 minutes.

Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was
first used to break up kidney stones. The technique has
been extended to the treatment of gallstones, in both the
gallbladder and bile ducts. It is often combined with
endoscopic procedures to ease the passage of fragmented
stones, or oral medications that can dissolve the frag-
ments. Rarely, stones are also dissolved by instilling vari-
ous chemicals such as ether directly into the bile ducts.

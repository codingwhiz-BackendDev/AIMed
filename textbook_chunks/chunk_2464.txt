Besides being a general antidote for poisons or reme-
dy for gas, activated charcoal has been used to treat other
conditions as well. Based on its ability to adsorb or bind
to other substances, charcoal has been effectively used to
clean skin wounds and to adsorb waste materials from the
gastrointestinal tract. In addition, it has been used to
adsorb snake venoms, viruses, bacteria, and harmful
materials excreted by bacteria or fungi. However, because
of lack of scientific studies, these uses are not recom-
mended. Activated charcoal, when used together with
other remedies such as aloe vera, acidophilus, and psylli-
um, helps to keep symptoms of ulcerative colitis under
control. While charcoal shows some anti-aging activity in
rats, it is doubtful if it can do the same for humans.

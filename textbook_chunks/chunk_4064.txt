Cluster headaches have been known as histamine
headaches, red migraines, and Hortonâ€™s disease, among
others. The constant factor is the pain, which transcends
by far the distress of the more common tension-type
headache or even that of a migraine headache.
Cluster headaches afflict less than 0.5% of the popu-
lation and predominantly affect men; approximately 80%
of sufferers are male. Onset typically occurs in the late
20s, but there is no absolute age restriction. Approximate-
ly 80% of cluster headaches are classified as episodic; the
remaining 20% are considered chronic. Both display the
same symptoms. However, episodic cluster headaches
occur during one- to five-month periods followed by six-
to 24-month attack-free, or remission, periods. There is
no such reprieve for chronic cluster headache sufferers.

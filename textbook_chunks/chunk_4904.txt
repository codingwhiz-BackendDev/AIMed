Normal findings on a CT exam show bone, the most
dense tissue, as white areas. Tissues and fat will show as
various shades of gray, and fluids will be gray or black.
Air will also look black. Intravenous, oral, and rectal con-
trast appear as white areas. The radiologist can determine
if tissues and organs appear normal by the sensitivity of
the gray shadows. In CT, the images that can cut through
a section of tissue or organ provide three-dimensional
viewing for the radiologist and referring physician.

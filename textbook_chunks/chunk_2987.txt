Amniotic sac—The membranous sac that sur-
rounds the embryo and fills with watery fluid as
pregnancy advances.

bottom doesn’t mold a passage through the birth
canal as well as does the head.

or so long and less than an inch around that makes
up the lower part and neck of the uterus. The
cervix separates the body and cavity of the uterus

Internal monitoring does not use ultrasound, is more
accurate than electronic monitoring and provides continu-
ous monitoring for the high risk mother. This requires the
mother’s water to be broken and that she be two to three
centimeters dilated. It is used in high-risk situations only.
Telemetry monitoring is the newest type of monitor-
ing. It uses radio waves transmitted from an instrument
on the mother’s thigh. The mother is able to remain
mobile. It provides continuous monitoring and is used in
high-risk situations.

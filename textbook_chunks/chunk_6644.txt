Cushingâ€™s syndrome is a relatively rare endocrine
(hormonal) disorder resulting from excessive exposure to
the hormone cortisol. The disorder, which leads to a vari-
ety of symptoms and physical abnormalities, is most
commonly caused by taking medications containing the
hormone over a long period of time. A more rare form of
the disorder occurs when the body itself produces an
excessive amount of cortisol.

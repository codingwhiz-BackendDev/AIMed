Serum chloride levels sometimes increase to abnor-
mal levels as an undesirable side effect of medical treat-
ment with sodium chloride or ammonium chloride. The
toxicity of chloride results not from the chloride itself, but
from the fact that the chloride occurs as the acid, hydro-
gen chloride (more commonly known as hydrochloric
acid, or HCl). An overdose of chloride may cause the
accumulation of hydrochloric acid in the bloodstream,
with consequent acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis, one of
many kidney diseases, involves the failure to release acid
into the urine. The acidosis produces weakness,
headache, nausea, and cardiac arrest. Low plasma chlo-
ride leads to the opposite situation: a decline in the acid
content of the bloodstream. This is known as alkalization
of the bloodstream, or alkalosis. Hydrochloric acid, origi-
nally from extracellular fluids, can be lost by vomiting. At
its most severe, alkalosis results in paralysis (tetany).
Hyperphosphatemia occurs at serum phosphate levels
above 5 mg/dL. It can result from the failure of the kidneys
to excrete phosphate into the urine, causing phosphate to
accumulate in the bloodstream. Hyperphosphatemia can
also be caused by the impaired action of parathyroid hor-
mone and by phosphate poisoning. Severe hyperphos-

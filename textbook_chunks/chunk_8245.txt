Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients
need to be vigilant about keeping their access sites and
catheters clean and infection-free during and between
dialysis runs.
Dialysis is just one facet of a comprehensive treat-
ment approach for ESRD. Although dialysis treatment is
very effective in removing toxins and fluids from the
body, there are several functions of the kidney it cannot
mimic, such as regulating high blood pressure and red
blood cell production. Patients with ESRD need to watch
their diet and fluid intake carefully and take medications
as prescribed to manage their disease.

Although other kinds of bacteria can cause cellulitis,
it is most often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (the
bacteria which causes strep throat) and Staphylococcus
aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes is the so-called “flesh-
eating bacteria” and, in rare cases, can cause a danger-
ous, deep skin infection called necrotizing fasciitis.
Orbital cellulitis may be caused by bacteria which cannot
grow in the presence of oxygen (anaerobic bacteria). In
children, Haemophilus influenzae type B frequently
causes orbital cellulitis following a sinus infection.
Streptococcus pyogenes can be picked up from a
person who has strep throat or an infected sore. Other
cellulitis-causing bacteria can be acquired from direct
contact with infected sores. Persons who are at a higher
risk for cellulitis are those who have a severe underlying
disease (such as cancer, diabetes, and kidney disease),
are taking steroid medications, have a reduced immune
system (because of AIDS, organ transplant, etc.), have
been burned, have insect bites, have reduced blood circu-
lation to limbs, or have had a leg vein removed for coro-
nary bypass surgery. In addition, chicken pox, human or
animal bite wounds, skin wounds, and recent surgery
can put a person at a higher risk for cellulitis.
The characteristic symptoms of cellulitis are red-
ness, warmth, pain, and swelling. The infected area
appears as a red patch that gets larger rapidly within the
first 24 hours. A thick red line which progresses towards
the heart may appear indicating an infection of the lymph
vessels (lymphangitis). Other symptoms which may
occur include fever, chills, tiredness, muscle aches, and a

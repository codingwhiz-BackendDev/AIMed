Cystitis is a common female problem. It is estimated
that 50% of adult women experience at least one episode
of dysuria (painful urination); half of these patients have
a bacterial UTI. Between 2–5% of women’s visits to pri-
mary care doctors are for UTI symptoms. About 90% of
UTIs in women are uncomplicated but recurrent.

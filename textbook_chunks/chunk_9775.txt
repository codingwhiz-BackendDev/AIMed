Ehrlichiosis may be diagnosed and treated by doc-
tors who specialize in blood diseases (hematologists) or
an infectious disease specialist. Because ehrlichiosis is
not very common and the symptoms are not unique, it
may be misdiagnosed. A recent history of a tick bite is
helpful in the diagnosis. Blood tests will be done to look
for antibodies to Ehrlichia. Staining and microscopic
examination of the blood sample may show Ehrlichia
bacteria inside white blood cells. Another test, called
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is a very sensitive
assay to detect bacteria in the blood sample, but it is not
always available.

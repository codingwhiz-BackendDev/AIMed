With prompt, expert treatment, clubfoot is usually
correctable. Most individuals are able to wear regular
shoes and lead active lives. If clubfoot is not appropriate-
ly treated, the abnormality becomes fixed. This has an
effect on the growth of the leg and foot, and some degree
of permanent disability usually results.

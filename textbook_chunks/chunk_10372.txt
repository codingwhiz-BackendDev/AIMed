Diagnosis of encephalitis includes careful question-
ing to determine possible exposure to viral sources. Tests
that can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other
disorders include:
• Blood tests. These are to detect antibodies to viral anti-
gens, and foreign proteins.
• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (spinal tap). This detects
viral antigens, and provides culture specimens for the
virus or bacteria that may be present in the cere-
brospinal fluid.
• Electroencephalogram (EEG).
• CT and MRI scans.
A brain biopsy (surgical gathering of a small tissue
sample) may be recommended in some cases where
treatment to date has been ineffective and the cause of
the encephalitis is unclear. Definite diagnosis by biopsy
may allow specific treatment that would otherwise be
too risky.

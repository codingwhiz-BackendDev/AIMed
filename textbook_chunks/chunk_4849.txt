Since complement deficiencies include a wide range
of disorders, the prognoses can also vary widely. Some
patients remain healthy their entire life. Others are hospi-
talized frequently because of infections which, if not
properly treated, can be fatal. Those with autoimmune
diseases could have a normal life expectancy. There are
some complement deficiencies, that have a high mortali-
ty rate. In those cases, death may occur within 10 years
after diagnosis.

The EEG is a key tool in the diagnosis and manage-
ment of epilepsy and other seizure disorders. It is also used
to assist in the diagnosis of brain damage and disease (e.g.,
stroke, tumors, encephalitis), mental retardation, sleep
disorders, degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s dis-
ease and Parkinson’s disease, and certain mental disor-
ders (e.g., alcoholism, schizophrenia, autism).
An EEG may also be used to monitor brain activity
during surgery and to determine brain death.

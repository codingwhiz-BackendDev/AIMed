Surgical resection requires an experienced surgeon,
preoperative assessment, imaging studies, and delicate
operative technique. Care should be taken during the pro-
cedure to avoid unnecessary tumor manipulation, which
can cause cancer cells to infiltrate adjacent structures. If
manipulation is excessive, cells can enter nearby areas
for future re-growth. Accurate isolation of the tumor can
also help to avoid contamination of the surgical area.
Early ligation of the blood supply to the tumor is an
essential component of a surgical cure.
Radiotherapy requires extensive treatment planning
and imaging. Care must be taken to localize the cancer
field while attempting to spare destruction of normal tis-
sue. This requires image monitoring and exact position-
ing during radiation treatment sessions.
Chemotherapy usually causes destruction of normal
cells, and cancer cells can become immune to chemical
destruction. Side effects and patient tolerance issues are
typically anticipated and dosages may have to be specifi-
cally altered. Very few chemotherapeutic agents offer
curative responses.
Biological therapies may cause patient toxicity
resulting in extensive side effects. This can occur since
the optimal dose may be exceedingly elevated above
patient tolerance.

The treatment of PSP is mostly supportive. If early
symptoms are recognized, the doctor will try to flush the
toxin from the gastrointestinal tract with medications that
create diarrhea. Vomiting may be induced if the patient
has no signs of weakness. In cases where the muscles of
breathing are weakened, the patient may be placed on a
respirator until the weakness goes away. However, this
measure is not usually needed. Likewise, the use of a
machine to clean the blood (dialysis) has been used in
severe cases.

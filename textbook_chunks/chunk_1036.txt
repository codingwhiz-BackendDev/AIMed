Because Candida is part of the normal group of
microorganisms that co-exist with all people, it is impos-
sible to avoid contact with it. Good vaginal hygiene and
good oral hygiene might reduce problems, but they are
not guarantees against candidiasis.
Because hospital-acquired (nosocomial) deep organ
candidiasis is on the rise, people need to be made aware
of it. Patients should be sure that catheters are properly
maintained and used for the shortest possible time
length. The frequency, length, and scope of courses of
antibiotic treatment should also be cut back.

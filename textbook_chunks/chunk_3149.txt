Choking is a medical emergency. When a person is
choking, air cannot reach the lungs. If the airways cannot
be cleared, death follows rapidly.
Anyone can choke, but choking is more common in
children than in adults. Choking is a common cause of
accidental death in young children who are apt to put toys
or coins in their mouths, then unintentionally inhale them.
About 3,000 adults die each year from choking on food.
People also choke because infection causes the
throat tissue to swell shut. It is believed that this is what
caused George Washingtonâ€™s death. Allergic reactions
can also cause the throat to swell shut. Acute allergic
reactions are called anaphylactic reactions and may be
fatal. Strangulation puts external pressure on the trachea
causing another form of choking.
Finally, people can choke from obstructive sleep
apnea. This is a condition where tissues of the body
obstruct the airways during sleep. Sleep apnea is most
common in obese men who sleep on their backs. Smok-
ing, heavy alcohol use, lung diseases such as emphyse-
ma, and an inherited tendency toward a narrowed airway
and throat all increase the risk of choking during sleep.

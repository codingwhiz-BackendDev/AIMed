The symptoms of fluke infection differ somewhat
according to the type of fluke involved. All forms of liver
and lung fluke infection, however, have the following
characteristics:
• most persons who get infected do not develop symp-
toms (asymptomatic)
• the early symptoms of an acute fluke infection are not
unique to these diseases alone (nonspecific symptoms)
• infection does not confer immunity against re-infection
by the same species or infection by other species of
flukes
• infection is usually associated with eating uncooked
fish, plants, or animals that live in fresh water

Symptoms of FA usually first appear between the
ages of 8 and 15, although onset as early as 18 months or
as late as age 25 is possible. The first symptom is usually
gait incoordination. A child with FA may graze doorways
when passing through, for instance, or trip over low
obstacles. Unsteadiness when standing still and deterio-
ration of position sense is common. Foot deformities and
walking up off the heels often results from uneven mus-
cle weakness in the legs. Muscle spasms and cramps
may occur, especially at night.
Ataxia in the arms follows, usually within several
years, leading to decreased hand-eye coordination. Arm
weakness does not usually occur until much later. Speech
and swallowing difficulties are common. Diabetes melli-
tus may also occur. Nystagmus, or eye tremor, is com-
mon, along with some loss of visual acuity. Hearing loss
may also occur. A side-to-side curvature of the spine (sco-
liosis) occurs in many cases, and may become severe.
Heartbeat abnormalities occur in about two thirds of
FA patients, leading to shortness of breath after exer-
tion, swelling in the lower limbs, and frequent com-
plaints of cold feet.

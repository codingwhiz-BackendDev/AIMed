Calcium channel blockers may interact with a num-
ber of other medications. When this happens, the effects
of one or both of the drugs may change or the risk of side
effects may increase. Anyone who takes calcium channel
blockers should not take any other prescription or non-
prescription (over-the-counter) medicines without first
checking with the prescribing physician. Substances that
may interact with calcium channel blockers include:
• Diuretics (water pills). This type of medicine may
cause low levels of potassium in the body, which may
increase the chance of unwanted effects from some cal-
cium channel blockers.
• Beta-blockers, such as atenolol (Tenormin), propra-
nolol (Inderal), and metoprolol (Lopressor), used to
treat high blood pressure, angina, and other conditions.
Also, eye drop forms of beta blockers, such as timolol
(Timoptic), used to treat glaucoma. Taking any of these
drugs with calcium channel blockers may increase the
effects of both types of medicine and may cause prob-
lems if either drug is stopped suddenly.
• Digitalis heart medicines. Taking these medicines with
calcium channel blockers may increase the action of the
heart medication.
• Medicines used to correct irregular heart rhythms, such as
quinidine (Quinidex), disopyramide (Norpace), and pro-
cainamide (Procan, Pronestyl). The effects of these drugs
may increase if used with calcium channel blockers.
• Anti-seizure medications such as carbamazepine (Tegre-
tol). Calcium channel drugs may increase the effects of
these medicines.
• Cyclosporine (Sandimmune), a medicine that suppress-
es the immune system. Effects may increase if this drug
is taken with calcium channel blockers.
• Grapefruit juice may increase the effects of some calci-
um channel blockers.

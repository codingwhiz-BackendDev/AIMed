Diagnosis relies on gathering information about the
circumstances of the accident, a thorough physical exami-
nation, and monitoring of cardiovascular and kidney activ-
ity. The victimâ€™s neurological condition can fluctuate rapid-
ly and requires close observation. A computed tomography
scan (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
may be necessary to check for brain injury.

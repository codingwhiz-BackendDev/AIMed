favor of chiropractic treatment. An estimated 15% of
people in the United States used chiropractic care in
1997. Chiropractors see the lionâ€™s share of all patients
who seek medical help for back problems.
Research has also supported the use of spinal manip-
ulation for acute low back pain. There is some anecdotal
evidence recommending chiropractic treatment for ail-
ments unrelated to musculoskeletal problems, but there is
not enough research-based data to support this. On the
other hand, a chiropractor may be able to treat problems
and diseases unrelated to the skeletal structure by
employing therapies other than spinal manipulation.
Although many chiropractors limit their practice to
spine and joint problems, others claim to treat disorders
that are not closely related to the back or musculoskeletal
system. These include asthma, bed-wetting, bronchitis,
coughs, dizziness, dysmenorrhea, earache, fainting,
headache,
hyperactivity,
indigestion,
infertility,
migraine, pneumonia, and issues related to pregnancy.
There are at least three explanations for possible efficacy
for these conditions. One is that the problem could be
linked to a nerve impingement, as may be possible with
bed-wetting, dizziness, fainting, and headache. In a sec-
ond group, chiropractic treatment may offer some relief
from complicating pain and spasms caused by the dis-
ease process, as with asthma, bronchitis, coughs, and
pneumonia. The discomforts of pregnancy may also be
relieved with gentle chiropractic therapy. A third possi-
bility is that manipulation or use of soft-tissue techniques
may directly promote improvement of some conditions.
One particular procedure, known as the endonasal tech-
nique, is thought to help the eustachian tube to open and
thus improve drainage of the middle ear. The tube is
sometimes blocked off due to exudates or inflammatory

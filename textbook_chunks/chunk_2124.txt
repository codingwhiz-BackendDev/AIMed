Most often, cervical cancer is first detected with a
Pap test that is performed as part of a regular pelvic
examination. The vagina is spread with a metal or plastic
instrument called a speculum. A swab is used to remove
mucus and cells from the cervix. This sample is sent to a
laboratory for microscopic examination.
The Pap test is a screening tool rather than a diag-
nostic tool. It is very efficient at detecting cervical
abnormalities. The Bethesda System commonly is used
to report Pap test results. A negative test means that no
abnormalities are present in the cervical tissue. A posi-
tive Pap test describes abnormal cervical cells as low-
grade or high-grade SIL, depending on the extent of
dysplasia. About 5â€“10% of Pap tests show at least mild
abnormalities. However, a number of factors other than
cervical cancer can cause abnormalities, including
inflammation from bacteria or yeast infections. A few
months after the infection is treated, the Pap test is
repeated.

Many methods of birth control have side effects.
Knowing the side effects can help a woman to determine
which method of birth control is right for her.
• Hormonal methods—The hormones in birth control
pills, Depo Provera, and Norplant can cause changes in
menstrual periods, changes in mood, weight gain, acne,
and headaches. In addition, it may take many months to
begin ovulating again once a woman stops using Depo
Provera or Norplant.
• Barrier methods—A woman must insert the diaphragm
in just the right way to be sure that it works properly.
Some women get more urinary tract infections if they
use a diaphragm. This is because the diaphragm can
press against the urethra, the tube that connects the
bladder to the outside.
• Spermicides—Some women and men are allergic to
spermicides or find them irritating to the skin.
• IUD—The IUD is a foreign body that stays inside the
uterus, and the uterus tries to get it out. A woman may
have heavier menstrual periods and more menstrual
cramping with an IUD in place.

Diskectomy—The surgical removal of a portion of
an invertebral disk.
Dura—The strongest and outermost of three mem-
branes that protect the brain, spinal cord, and
nerves of the cauda equina.
Herniated disk—A blisterlike bulging or protrusion
of the contents of the disk out through the fibers
that normally hold them in place. It is also called a
ruptured disk, slipped disk, or displaced disk.
Intervertebral disk—Cylindrical elastic-like gel
pads that separate and join each pair of vertebrae
in the spine.
Laminectomy—An operation in which the sur-
geon cuts through the covering of a vertebra to
reach a herniated disk in order to remove it.
Vertebra—The bones that make up the back bone
(spine).
extremely small. (The risk of death from general anes-
thesia for all types of surgery, for example, is only about
1 in 1,600.)
The most common risk of the surgery is infection,
which occurs in 1–2% of cases. Rarely, the surgery can
damage nerves in the lower back or major blood vessels
in front of the disk. Occasionally, there may be some
residual paralysis of a particular leg or bladder muscle
after surgery, but this is the result of the disk problem
that necessitated the surgery, not the operation itself.
While disk removals can relieve pain in 90% of
cases, there are some people who do not get pain relief,
depending on how long they had the condition requiring
surgery and other factors.

In its most common form, cocaine is a whitish crys-
talline powder that produces feelings of euphoria when
ingested.
Now classified as a Schedule II drug, cocaine has
legitimate medical uses as well as a long history of recre-
ational abuse. Administered by a licensed physician, the
drug can be used as a local anesthetic for certain eye and
ear problems and in some kinds of surgery.

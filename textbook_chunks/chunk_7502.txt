When treating dehydration, the underlying cause
must also be addressed. For example, if dehydration is
caused by vomiting or diarrhea, medications may be pre-
scribed to resolve these symptoms. Patients who are
dehydrated due to diabetes, kidney disease, or adrenal
gland disorders must receive treatment for these condi-
tions as well as for the resulting dehydration.

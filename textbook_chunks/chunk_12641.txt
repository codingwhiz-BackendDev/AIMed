Fecal incontinence is a problem that usually
responds well to professional medical treatment, even
among elderly and institutionalized patients. If com-
plete bowel control cannot be restored, the impact of
incontinence on everyday life can still be lessened con-
siderably in most cases. When incontinence remains a
problem despite medical treatment, disposable under-
wear and other commercial incontinence products are
available to make life easier. Doctors and nurses can
offer advice on coping with incontinence, and people
should never be embarrassed about seeking their assis-
tance. Counseling and information are also available
from support groups.

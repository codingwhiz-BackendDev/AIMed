Recent scientific research has indicated that the size of the
subgenual prefrontal cortex of the brain (located behind the
bridge of the nose) may be a determining factor in heredi-

drugs may not be a preferred treatment option for patients
at risk for suicide.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIS) such as
tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenelzine (Nardil) block
the action of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme in
the central nervous system. Patients taking MAOIs must
cut foods high in tyramine (found in aged cheeses and
meats) out of their diet to avoid potentially serious
hypertensive side effects.
Heterocyclics include bupropion (Wellbutrin) and tra-
zodone (Desyrel). Bupropion should not be prescribed to
patients with a seizure disorder. Side effects of the drug
may include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor, dry
mouth, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, low blood
pressure, and insomnia. Because trazodone has a sedative
effect, it is useful in treating depressed patients with insom-
nia. Other possible side effects of trazodone include dry
mouth, gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, and headache.

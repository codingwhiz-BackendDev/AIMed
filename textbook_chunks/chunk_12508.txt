Those fasting may experience side effects of
fatigue, malaise, aches and pains, emotional duress,
acne, headaches, allergies, swelling, vomiting, bad
breath, and symptoms of colds and flu. These reactions
are sometimes called healing crises, which are caused by
temporarily increased levels of toxins in the body due to
elimination and cleansing. Lower energy levels should be
expected during a fast.

Not every laboratory is equipped to evaluate EPO,
so the reference laboratory (a large commercial lab that
does tests for hospitals not equipped to do them) per-
forming the test may require as many as four days to
complete the analysis. It should also be noted that EPO
values increase in pregnancy, in which significantly
higher levels are found before the twenty-fourth week.

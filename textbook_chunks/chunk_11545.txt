The esophagus is the swallowing tube through
which food passes on its way from the mouth to the
stomach. The main function of this organ is to propel
food down into the stomach. There is also a mechanism
to prevent food from coming back up or “refluxing” from
the stomach into the esophagus. Esophageal function
tests are used to determine if these processes are normal
or abnormal.

The majority of CNS stimulants are chemically sim-
ilar to the neurohormone norepinephrine, and simulate
the traditional “fight or flight” syndrome associated with
sympathetic nervous system arousal. Caffeine is more
closely related to the xanthines, such as theophylline. A
small number of additional members of the CNS stimu-
lant class do not fall into specific chemical groups.

A fever is usually diagnosed using a thermometer. A
variety of different thermometers are available, including
traditional glass and mercury ones used for oral or rectal
temperature readings and more sophisticated electronic
ones that can be inserted in the ear to quickly register the
body’s temperature. For adults and older children, temper-
ature readings are usually taken orally. Younger children
who cannot or will not hold a thermometer in their mouths
can have their temperature taken by placing an oral ther-
mometer under their armpit. Infants generally have their
temperature taken rectally using a rectal thermometer.
As important as registering a patient’s temperature is
determining the underlying cause of the fever. The pres-
ence or absence of accompanying symptoms, a patient’s
medical history, and information about what he or she
may have ingested, any recent trips taken, or possible
exposures to illness help the physician make a diagnosis.
Blood tests can aid in identifying an infectious agent by
detecting the presence of antibodies against it or provid-
ing samples for growth of the organism in a culture.
Blood tests can also provide the doctor with white blood
cell counts. Ultrasound tests, magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) tests, or computed tomography (CT) scans

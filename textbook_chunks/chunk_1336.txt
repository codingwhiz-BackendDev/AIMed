If a person suddenly becomes unconscious, a rescuer
should call out for help from other bystanders, and then
determine if the unconscious person is responsive by
gently shaking the shoulder and shouting a question.
Upon receiving no answer, the rescuer should call the
emergency medical system. The rescuer should check to
see whether the unconscious person is breathing by
kneeling near the person’s shoulders, looking at the per-
son’s chest, and placing a cheek next to the unconscious
person’s mouth. The rescuer should look for signs of
breathing in the chest and abdomen, and listen and feel
for signs of breathing through the person’s lips. If no
signs of breathing are present after three to five seconds,
CPR should be started.

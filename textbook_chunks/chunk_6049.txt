Bleaching is done to lighten teeth that are stained
or discolored. It entails the use of a bleaching solution
applied by a dentist or a gel in a tray that fits over the
teeth used at home under a dentistâ€™s supervision. Bond-
ing involves applying tooth-colored plastic putty, called
composite resin, to the surface of chipped or broken
teeth. This resin is also used to fill cavities in front teeth
(giving a more natural-looking result) and to fill gaps
between teeth. Veneers are thin, porcelain shells that
cover the front of the teeth. They can improve the
appearance of damaged, discolored, misshapen, or mis-
aligned teeth. Reshaping involves the removal of enam-
el from a misshapen tooth so that it matches other teeth.
Orthodontics uses braces to correct the position of
crowded or misaligned teeth. Implants are artificial
teeth which are attached directly to the jaw to replace
missing teeth.

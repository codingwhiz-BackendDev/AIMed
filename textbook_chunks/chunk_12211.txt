Munchausen syndrome refers to patients whose
factitious symptoms are dramatized and exaggerated.
Many persons with Munchausen go so far as to undergo
major surgery repeatedly, and, to avoid detection, at sev-
eral locations. Many have been employed in hospitals or
in health care professions. The syndromeâ€™s onset is in
early adulthood.

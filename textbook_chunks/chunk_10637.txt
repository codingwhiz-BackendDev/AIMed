ERUS has been used as a means to determine the
depth of rectal cancers and to assess whether the tumor
has affected surrounding tissues. This pre-treatment pro-
cedure has proven to be an accurate tool for tailoring
surgery for patients.
Problems with interpretation of the sonograms after
radiation and before surgery have resulted in tumors
being identified that were merely the formation of
fibrous tissues that remained after the tumors had been
eliminated by the radiation. Yet, some of the fibrous
areas actually hid residual tumors. Rectal anatomy itself
can affect the accuracy of ultrasound reading. This
makes ERUS problematic in determining the amount of
tumor reduction a patient has after radiation therapy.

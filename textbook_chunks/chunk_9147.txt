Oxytocin has caused irregular heartbeat and increased
bleeding in some women after delivery. It may also cause
jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin) in newborns.
Other side effects are rare, but may include nausea,
vomiting, confusion, dizziness, convulsions, breathing
problems, headache, hives, skin rash, itching, pelvic or
abdominal pain, and weakness. The nasal spray form
may cause watery eyes or irritation of the nose.

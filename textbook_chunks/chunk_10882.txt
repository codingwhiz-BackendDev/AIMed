First, a physician will rule out other potential causes
of the itching, such as hemorrhoids, lice, or fungal or
bacterial infection. Once these have been ruled out, an
accurate diagnosis of enterobiasis will require that either
the eggs or the adult worms are detected. Rarely, the adult
worms are seen as thin, yellowish-white threads, about
0.4 in (1 cm) long, in the stools of the infected person.
Usually, an hour or so after the individual goes to sleep,
the adult female worms may be seen moving around lay-
ing eggs if a flashlight is shone at the rectal area.
An easier method is to observe the eggs under the
microscope. In order to collect a specimen for laboratory
diagnosis, the physician may provide a paddle with a
sticky adhesive on one side, or an individual may be
instructed to place a piece of shiny cellophane tape sticky
side down against the anal opening. The best time to per-
form this test is at night or as soon as the individual
wakes up in the morning, before having a bowel move-
ment or taking a bath or shower. The pinworm eggs will
stick to the tape, which can then be placed on a specimen

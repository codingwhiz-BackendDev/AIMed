Devices known as continuous passive motion
machines are very popular, especially following surgery
of joints. Continuous passive motion machines (CPM)
are specifically adjusted to each individual’s need. This
method is administered within the first 24–72 hours after
the injury or surgery. The joint is mechanically moved
through the patient’s tolerable motion. CPM machines
have been proved to accelerate the return motion process,
allowing patients more function in less time.

It may be possible to avoid the need for an episioto-
my. Pregnant women may want to talk with their care
providers about the use of episiotomy during the deliv-
ery. Kegel exercises are often recommended during the
pregnancy to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.
Prenatal perineal massage may help to stretch and relax
the tissue around the vaginal opening. During the deliv-
ery process, warm compresses can be applied to the area
along with the use of perineal massage. Coaching and
support are also important during the delivery process. A
slowed, controlled pushing during the second stage of
labor (when the mother gets the urge to push) may allow
the tissues to stretch rather than tear. Also, an upright
birthing position (rather than one where the mother is
lying down) may decrease the need for an episiotomy.

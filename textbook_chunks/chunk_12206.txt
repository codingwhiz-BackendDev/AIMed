Factitious disorders are a group of mental distur-
bances in which patients intentionally act physically or
mentally ill without obvious benefits. The name facti-
tious comes from a Latin word that means artificial.
These disorders are not malingering, which is defined as
pretending illness when the “patient” has a clear motive,
such as financial gain.

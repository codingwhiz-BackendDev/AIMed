In corneal transplant, also known as keratoplasty, a
patientâ€™s damaged cornea is replaced by the cornea from
the eye of a human cadaver. This is the single most com-
mon type of human transplant surgery and has the high-
est success rate. Eye banks acquire and store eyes from
donor individuals largely to supply the need for trans-
plant corneas.

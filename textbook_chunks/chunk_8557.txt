The symptoms of diphtheria are caused by toxins
produced by the diphtheria bacillus, Corynebacterium
diphtheriae (from the Greek for “rubber membrane”). In
fact, toxin production is related to infections of the bacil-
lus itself with a particular bacteria virus called a phage
(from bacteriophage; a virus that infects bacteria). The
intoxication destroys healthy tissue in the upper area of
the throat around the tonsils, or in open wounds in the
skin. Fluid from the dying cells then coagulates to form
the telltale gray or grayish green membrane. Inside the
membrane, the bacteria produce an exotoxin, which is a
poisonous secretion that causes the life-threatening
symptoms of diphtheria. The exotoxin is carried through-
out the body in the bloodstream, destroying healthy tis-
sue in other parts of the body.
The most serious complications caused by the exo-
toxin are inflammations of the heart muscle (myocardi-
tis) and damage to the nervous system. The risk of seri-
ous complications is increased as the time between onset
of symptoms and the administration of antitoxin increas-
es, and as the size of the membrane formed increases.
The myocarditis may cause disturbances in the heart
rhythm and may culminate in heart failure. The symp-
toms of nervous system involvement can include seeing
double (diplopia), painful or difficult swallowing, and
slurred speech or loss of voice, which are all indications
of the exotoxin’s effect on nerve functions. The exotoxin
may also cause severe swelling in the neck (“bull neck”).
The signs and symptoms of diphtheria vary accord-
ing to the location of the infection:

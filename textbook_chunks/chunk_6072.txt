Costochondritis causes pain in the lower rib area or
upper breastbone. Some patients fear they are having a
heart attack. The most severe pain is usually between the
breast and the upper abdomen. The pain may be greater
when in sitting or reclining positions. Stress may aggra-
vate this condition. Generally the third or fourth ribs are
affected. However, any of the seven costochondral junc-
tions may be affected, and more often than not more than
one site is involved. The inflammation can involve carti-
lage areas on both sides of the sternum, but usually is on
one side only. Costochondritis should be distinguished
from Tietze Syndrome, which is an inflammation involv-
ing the same area of the chest, but also includes swelling.

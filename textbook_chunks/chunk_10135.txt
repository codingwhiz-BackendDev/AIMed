External EFM poses no direct risks to the baby. How-
ever, because of being connected to the machine, the
mother cannot walk around. This inactivity may prolong
labor and reduce oxygen levels in the motherâ€™s blood, both
of which can be detrimental to the unborn baby. Another
problem is that electronic fetal monitoring seems to be
associated with an increase in caesarian deliveries. There
is a concern that EFM can give false alarms of distress in
the baby, and that this can lead to unneeded caesarians.
With internal monitoring, there is a higher risk for infec-
tion. For these and other reasons, the United States Pre-
ventive Services Task Force states that there is some evi-
dence that using electronic fetal monitoring on low-risk
women in labor might not be indicated. Many physicians,
however, continue to use EFM routinely, and believe it to
be of value in both low-risk and high-risk labors.

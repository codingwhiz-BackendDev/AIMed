To propel food into the stomach (or out of it during
vomiting) the esophagus generates internal pressure just
like the bowel. Under certain circumstances, that pressure
can herniate the esophageal lining through a weakness in
the wall, creating a pouch (a balloon squeezed in the hand
will herniate through the fingers in the same way). Pouch-
es are more common in people who have motility disor-
ders of the esophagus, swallowing that is not well coordi-
nated and may be spastic. A traction diverticulum can
develop from a scar that pulls the esophagus out of shape.
Food and saliva can collect in all of these pouches.
Pouches in the neck usually cause bad breath (hali-
tosis) and the regurgitation of swallowed food and saliva.
Some patients with Zenkerâ€™s diverticula can push on their
neck and make old food appear in their mouths. Pouches
near the stomach may cause swallowing problems, condi-
tions known as achalasia or dysphagia. Mid-esophageal
pouches usually cause no symptoms.
In the most serious cases, a person may be unable to
swallow because the esophagus is obstructed, or the
esphagus may rupture, spilling its contents into the chest
or neck.

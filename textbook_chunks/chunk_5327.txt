ing a child with a congenital heart disease increases if the
mother or father, another child, or another relative had
congenital heart disease or a family history of sudden
death. Viral infections, such as German measles, can pro-
duce congenital heart disease. Women with diabetes and
phenylketonuria also are at higher risk of having chil-
dren with congenital heart defects. Many cases of congen-
ital heart disease result from the mother’s excessive use of
alcohol or taking illegal drugs, such as cocaine, while
pregnant. The mother’s exposure to certain anticonvulsant
and dermatologic drugs during pregnancy can also cause
congenital heart disease. There are many genetic condi-
tions, such as Down syndrome, which affect multiple
organs and can cause congenital heart disease.

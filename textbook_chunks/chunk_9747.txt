lead to a diagnosis of EDS. Specific tests, such as skin
biopsies are available for diagnosis of certain types of
EDS, including vascular, arthrochalasia, and der-
matosparaxis types. A skin biopsy involves removing a
small sample of skin and examining its microscopic struc-
ture. A urine test is available for the Kyphoscoliosis type.
Management of all types of EDS may include genet-
ic counseling to help the affected individual and their
family understand the disorder and its impact on other
family members and future children.
If a couple has had a child diagnosed with EDS the
chance that they will have another child with the same
disorder depends on with what form of EDS the child has
been diagnosed and if either parent is affected by the
same disease or not.
Individuals diagnosed with an autosomal dominant
form of EDS have a 50% chance of passing the same disor-
der on to a child in each pregnancy. Individuals diagnosed
with an autosomal recessive form of EDS have an extreme-
ly low risk of having a child with the same disorder.
X-linked recessive EDS is accompanied by a slight-
ly more complicated pattern of inheritance. If a father
with an X-linked recessive form of EDS passes a copy of
his X chromosome to his children, the sons will be unaf-
fected and the daughters will be carriers. If a mother is a
carrier for an X-linked recessive form of EDS, she may
have affected or unaffected sons, or carrier or unaffected
daughters, depending on the second sex chromosome
inherited from the father.
Prenatal diagnosis is available for specific forms of
EDS, including kyphosocliosis type and vascular type.
However, prenatal testing is only a possibility in these
types if the underlying defect has been found in another
family member.

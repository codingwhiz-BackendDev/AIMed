Many researchers now treat the BSE-vCJD connec-
tion as solidly established.
Assuming that BSE is the source, the question that
has loomed from the beginning has been is how many
people will eventually be affected. Epidemiological
models of infectious disease produce estimates ranging
from less than one hundred (a level already broken) to
tens of thousands or more, depending on the assumptions
used by the modelers. The incubation period of vCJD in
humans is not known, nor are the genetic and environ-
mental risk factors that influence susceptibility, nor the
quantity of infectious agent needed to cause the disease.
It is estimated that between one and two million infected
cattle have been eaten by humans, most in the earliest
stages of the epidemic. Estimates cannot be based on the
very few cases that have developed so far. These cases
could represent the very few people with the right combi-
nation of exposure and susceptibility to a relatively fast-
developing infection, or they could be the first few vic-
tims of a slower-acting, more highly infectious agent.

Casting or splinting techniques are used to provide a
constant stretch to the soft tissues surrounding a joint. It
is most effective when used to increase motion of a joint
from prolonged immobilization. It is also popular for
treating contractures resulting from an increase in muscle
tone from nerve injury. After an initial holding cast is
applied for seven to 10 days, a series of positional casts
are applied at weekly intervals. Before the application of
each new cast, the joint is moved as much as can be toler-
ated by the patient, and measured by a goniometer. When
as much motion as possible is obtained after stretching,
another final cast is applied to maintain the newly
acquired motion.

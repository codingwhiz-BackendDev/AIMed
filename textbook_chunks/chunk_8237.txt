In peritoneal dialysis, the patient’s peritoneum, or lin-
ing of the abdomen, acts as a blood filter. A catheter is sur-
gically inserted into the patient’s abdomen. During treat-
ment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavity with
dialysate. Waste products and excess fluids move from the
patient’s bloodstream into the dialysate solution. After a
waiting period of six to 24 hours, depending on the treat-
ment method used, the waste-filled dialysate is drained
from the abdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate.

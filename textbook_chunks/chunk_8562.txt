Pharyngeal diphtheria gets its name from the phar-
ynx, which is the part of the upper throat that connects
the mouth and nasal passages with the voice box. This is
the most common form of diphtheria, causing the charac-
teristic throat membrane. The membrane often bleeds if
it is scraped or cut. It is important not to try to remove
the membrane because the trauma may increase the
body’s absorption of the exotoxin. Other signs and symp-
toms of pharyngeal diphtheria include mild sore throat,
fever of 101–102°F (38.3–38.9°C), a rapid pulse, and
general body weakness.

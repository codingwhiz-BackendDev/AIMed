Child abuse can have lifelong consequences.
Research shows that abused children and adolescents are
more likely, for instance, to do poorly in school, suffer
emotional problems, develop an antisocial personality,
become promiscuous, abuse drugs and alcohol, and
attempt suicide. As adults they often have trouble estab-
lishing intimate relationships. Whether professional treat-
ment is able to moderate the long-term psychological
effects of abuse is a question that remains unanswered.

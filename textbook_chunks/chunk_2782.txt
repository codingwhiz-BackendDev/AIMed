Routine chest x rays consist of two views, the frontal
view (referred to as posterioranterior or PA), and the lat-
eral (side) view. It is preferred that the patient stand for
this exam, particularly when studying collection of fluid
in the lungs.
During the actual time of exposure, the technologist
will ask the patient to hold his or her breath. It is very
important in taking a chest x ray to ensure there is no
motion that could detract from the quality and sharpness
of the film image. The procedure will only take a few
minutes and the time patients must hold their breaths is a
matter of a few seconds.
The chest x ray may be performed in a physicianâ€™s
office or referred to an outpatient radiology facility or
hospital radiology department. In some cases, particular-
ly for bedridden patients, a portable chest x ray may be
taken. Portable films are sometimes of poorer quality
than those taken with permanent equipment, but are the
best choice for some patients or situations. Bedridden
patients may be placed in as upright a position as possi-
ble to get a clear picture, particularly of chest fluid.

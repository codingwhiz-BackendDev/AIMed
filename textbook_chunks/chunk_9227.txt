Description
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is a disorder
that occurs most frequently in women at the beginning
and end of their reproductive lives. About half the cases
occur in women over 45 years of age, and about one fifth
occur in women under age 20.
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is diagnosed when
other causes of uterine bleeding have been eliminated.
Failure of the ovary to release an egg during the menstru-
al cycle occurs in about 70% of women with DUB. This
is probably related to a hormonal imbalance.
DUB is common in women who have polycystic
ovary syndrome (cysts on the ovaries). Women who are
on dialysis may also have heavy or prolonged periods. So
do some women who use an intrauterine device (IUD)
for birth control.
DUB is similar to several other types of uterine bleed-
ing disorders and sometimes overlaps these conditions.

Constipation is an acute or chronic condition in
which bowel movements occur less often than usual or
consist of hard, dry stools that are painful or difficult to
pass. Bowel habits vary, but an adult who has not had a
bowel movement in three days or a child who has not had
a bowel movement in four days is considered constipated.

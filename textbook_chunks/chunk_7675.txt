The virus that causes dengue fever is called an
arbovirus, which stands for arthropod-borne virus. Mos-
quitoes are a type of arthropod. In a number of regions,
mosquitoes carry this virus and are responsible for pass-
ing it along to humans. These regions include the Middle
East, the far East, Africa, and the Caribbean Islands. In
these locations, the dengue fever arbovirus is endemic,
meaning that the virus naturally and consistently lives in
that location. The disease only shows up in the United
States sporadically.
In order to understand how dengue fever is transmit-
ted, several terms need to be defined. The word “host”
means an animal (including a human) that can be infect-
ed with a particular disease. The word “vector” means an
organism that can carry a particular disease-causing
agent (like a virus or bacteria) without actually develop-
ing the disease. The vector can then pass the virus or bac-
teria on to a new host.
Many of the common illnesses in the United States
(including the common cold, many viral causes of diar-
rhea, and influenza or “flu”) are spread because the
viruses that cause these illness can be passed directly
from person to person. However, dengue fever cannot be
passed directly from one infected person to another.
Instead, the virus responsible for dengue fever requires
an intermediate vector, a mosquito, that carries the virus
from one host to another. The mosquito that carries the
arbovirus responsible for dengue fever is the same type
of mosquito that can transmit other diseases, including
yellow fever. This mosquito is called Aedes egypti. The
most common victims are children younger than 10 years
of age.

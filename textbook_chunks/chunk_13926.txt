Any child with signs of developmental delay of
speech, language, or motor development with no known
cause should be considered for fragile X testing, espe-
cially if there is a family history of the condition. Behav-
ioral and developmental problems may indicate fragile X
syndrome, particularly if there is a family history of
mental retardation. Definitive identification of the fragile
X syndrome is made by means of a genetic test to assess
the number of CGG sequence repeats in the FMR-1
gene. Individuals with the premutation or full mutation
may be identified through genetic testing. Genetic test-
ing for the fragile X mutation can be done on the devel-
oping baby before birth through amniocentesis or chori-
onic villus sampling (CVS), and is 99% effective in
detecting the condition due to trinucleotide repeat expan-
sion. Prenatal testing should only be undertaken after the
fragile X carrier status of the parents has been confirmed
and the couple has been counseled regarding the risks of
recurrence. While prenatal testing is possible to do with
CVS, the results can be difficult to interpret and addition-
al testing may be required.

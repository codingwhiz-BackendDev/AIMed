The fungus causing cryptococcus, C. neoformans, is
found worldwide in soil contaminated with pigeon or
other bird droppings. It has also been found on unwashed
raw fruit. Cryptococcosis is a rare disease in healthy
individuals, but is the most common fungal infection
affecting people with AIDS.
People with Hodgkinâ€™s disease or who are taking
large doses of drugs that suppress the functioning of the
immune system (corticosteroids, chemotherapy drugs)
are also more susceptible to cryptococcal infection.
Cryptococcosis is also called cryptococcal meningitis
(when the brain is infected), Busse-Buschke disease,
European blastomycosis, torular meningitis, or torulosis.

Colchicine is a chemical compound that can be used
as a medication, and is frequently prescribed for gout.
Some years ago, colchicine was discovered to also be
effective in reducing the frequency and severity of
attacks in FMF. Treatment for FMF at this point consists
of taking colchicine daily. Studies have shown that about
75% of FMF patients achieve complete remission of
their symptoms, and about 95% show marked improve-
ment when taking colchicine. Lower effectiveness has
been reported, but there is some question about the num-
ber of FMF patients who choose not to take their
colchicine between attacks when they are feeling well,
and thus lose some of the ability to prevent attacks. Com-
pliance with taking colchicine every day may be ham-
pered by its side effects, which include diarrhea, nausea,
abdominal bloating, and gas. There is a theoretical risk
that colchicine use could damage chromosomes in
sperms and eggs, or in an embryo during pregnancy, or
that it might reduce fertility. However, studies looking at
reproduction in men and women who have used
colchicine have so far not shown any increased risks.
Colchicine is also effective in preventing, delaying, or
reversing renal disease associated with amyloidosis.
Other medications may be used as needed to deal
with the pain and fever associated with FMF attacks.
Dialysis and/or renal transplant might become necessary
in someone with advanced kidney disease. Given its
genetic nature, there is no cure for FMF, nor is there likely
to be in the near future. Any couple that has a child diag-
nosed with FMF, or anyone with a family history of the
condition (especially those in high-risk ethnic groups),
should be offered genetic counseling to obtain the most
up-to-date information on FMF and testing options.

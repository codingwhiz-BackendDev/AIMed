Anyone suffering from gas, bloating, cramping
pains, acne and other skin complaints, arthritis, and a list
of bowel complaints such as diverticulitis and irritable
bowel etc., may benefit from colonic irrigation. In partic-
ular, cancer patients are often advised to undertake a
course of colonic irrigation sessions as an essential part
of their treatment. When a biological cancer therapy
begins to enable the body to breakdown a cancerous
mass, it is essential that speedy and effective elimination
of the resulting toxins is achieved.
Colon and bowel cancer is one of the leading causes
of death in the United States, and alternative practitioners
insist that it can be prevented by efficient hygiene proce-
dures. Providing that care is taken to replace the natural
organisms that flourish in the bowel, many health benefits
can be expected from colonic irrigation. In general, alter-
native practitioners maintain that an ill-functioning bowel
is the source of all disease, and therefore keeping it clean
will be an effective protection against this.
Removing large amounts of toxic matter relieves the
patient and can lead to the alleviation of symptoms such
as arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, candidiasis, and
a host of other illnesses. Properly executed, colonic irriga-
tion can help restore normal peristaltic action to a slug-
gish bowel, thus reducing the need for more hydrotherapy
treatments over time. In addition, removing the layer of
fecal matter which coats the intestines in many individu-
als allows improved assimilation of the nutrients from
foods and can alleviate symptoms of vitamin and other
nutrient deficiencies. Many alternative health practition-
ers consider some form of hydrotherapy for the bowel to
be essential in the treatment of degenerative diseases.

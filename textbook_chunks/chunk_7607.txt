Some studies have indicated that delusions may be
generated by abnormalities in the limbic system, the por-
tion of the brain on the inner edge of the cerebral cortex
that is believed to regulate emotions. The exact source of
delusions has not been conclusively found, but potential
causes include genetics, neurological abnormalities, and
changes in brain chemistry. Delusions are also a known
possible side effect of drug use and abuse (e.g., ampheta-
mines, cocaine, PCP).

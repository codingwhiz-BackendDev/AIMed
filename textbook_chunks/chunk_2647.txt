Patients may take chemotherapy at home, in the doc-
tor’s office, or as an inpatient or outpatient at the hospi-
tal. Most patients stay in the hospital when first begin-
ning chemotherapy, so their doctor can check for any
side effects and change the dose if needed.
How often and how long chemotherapy is given
depends on the type of cancer, how patients respond to
the drugs, patients’ health and ability to tolerate the
drugs, and the types of drugs given. Chemotherapy
administration may take only a few minutes or may last
as long as several hours. Chemotherapy may be given
daily, weekly, or monthly. A rest period may follow a
course of treatment before the next course begins. In
combination chemotherapy, more than one drug may be
given at a time, or they may be given alternately, one fol-
lowing the other.

As with any surgical procedure, there are some risks
involved with a cystoscopy. Complications may include:
profuse bleeding; a damaged urethra; a perforated blad-
der; a urinary tract infection; or an injured penis.
Patients should also contact their physician if they
experience any of the following symptoms following
surgery: pain, redness, swelling, drainage, or bleeding
from the surgical site; signs of infection that may include
headache, muscle aches, dizziness or an overall ill feel-
ing and fever; nausea or vomiting; strenuous or painful
urination; or symptoms that may result as side-effects
from the medication.

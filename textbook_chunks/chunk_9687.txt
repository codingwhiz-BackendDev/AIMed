Edwardsâ€™ syndrome is caused by an extra copy of
chromosome 18. For this reason, it is also called trisomy 18
syndrome. The extra chromosome is lethal for most babies
born with this condition. It causes major physical abnor-
malities and severe mental retardation, and very few chil-
dren afflicted with this disease survive beyond a year.

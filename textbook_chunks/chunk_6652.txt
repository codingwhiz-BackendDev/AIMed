The most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is
the long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones in medica-
tions. Medications such as prednisone are used in a num-
ber of inflammatory conditions. Such conditions include
rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, vasculitis, lupus, and a
variety of other autoimmune disorders in which the
body’s immune cells accidentally attack some part of the
body itself. In these disorders, the glucocorticoids are
used to dampen the immune response, thereby decreas-
ing damage to the body.
Cushing’s syndrome can also be caused by three dif-
ferent categories of disease:
• a pituitary tumor producing abnormally large quantities
of ACTH
• the abnormal production of ACTH by some source
other than the pituitary
• a tumor within the adrenal gland overproducing cortisol
Although it is rare, about two-thirds of endoge-
nous (occurring within the body rather than from a
source outside the body, like a medication) Cushing’s
syndrome is a result of Cushing’s disease. The term
“Cushing’s disease” refers to Cushing’s syndrome,
which is caused by excessive secretion of ACTH by a
pituitary tumor, usually an adenoma (noncancerous
tumor). The pituitary tumor causes increased growth of
the adrenal cortex (hyperplasia) and increased cortisol
production. Cushing’s disease affects women more
often than men.
Tumors in locations other than the pituitary can also
produce ACTH. This is called ectopic ACTH syndrome
(“ectopic” refers to something existing out of its normal
place). Tumors in the lung account for more than half of
all cases of ectopic ACTH syndrome. Other types of
tumors that may produce ACTH include tumors of the
thymus, the pancreas, the thyroid, and the adrenal gland.
Nearly all adrenal gland tumors are benign (noncancer-
ous), although in rare instances a tumor may actually be
cancerous.

Before beginning any exercise program, an evalua-
tion by a physician is recommended to rule out any poten-
tial health risks. Once health and fitness are determined,
and any or all physical restrictions identified, an individ-
ualâ€™s exercise program should be under the supervision of
a health care professional. This is especially the case
when exercise is used as a form of rehabilitation. If symp-
toms of dizziness, nausea, excessive shortness of breath,
or chest pain are present during any exercise program, an
individual should stop the activity and inform a physician
about these symptoms before resuming activity. Exercise
equipment must be checked to determine if it can bear the
weight of people of all sizes and shapes.

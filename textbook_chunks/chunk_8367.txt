It is especially important to find the cause of diar-
rhea, since stopping diarrhea when it is the body’s way of
eliminating something foreign is not helpful and can be
harmful in the long run.
One effective alternative approach to preventing and
treating diarrhea involves oral supplementation of
aspects of the normal flora in the colon with the yeasts
Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bifidus, or Saccharomyces
boulardii. In clinical settings, these “biotherapeutic”
agents have repeatedly been helpful in the resolution of
diarrhea, especially antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Their
effectiveness is also supported by the results of a
research study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association in 1996.

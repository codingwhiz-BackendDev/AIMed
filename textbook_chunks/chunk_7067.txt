The urinary bladder stores urine produced by the kid-
neys. The main muscle of the bladder wall, the detrusor,
relaxes to allow expansion of the bladder during filling.
The urethra, the tube through which urine exits, is held
closed by a ring of muscle, known as the urethral sphinc-
ter. As volume increases, stretching of the detrusor and
pressure on the sphincter sends signals to the brain, indi-
cating the need for urination, or voiding. Voluntary relax-
ation of the sphincter and automatic contractions of the
detrusor allow successful and virtually complete voiding.
A cystometry study is performed to diagnose prob-
lems with urination, including incontinence, urinary
retention, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Urinary
difficulties may occur because of weak or hyperactive
sphincter or detrusor, or incoordination of their two

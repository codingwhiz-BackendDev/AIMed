The prognosis for CTCL is dependent on the stage of
the disease. Prognosis is very good if the disease has only
progressed to Stage IA, with a mean survival of 20 or
more years. At this point, the disease is a very low mortali-
ty risk to the patient, with most deaths occurring to per-
sons in this group unrelated to CTCL. For patients diag-
nosed at stages IB and IIA, the median survival is about 12
years. The disease in both of these stages involves inter-
mediate risk to the patient. Patients in stage III and IVA

Because V. cholerae bacteria are sensitive to acid,
most cholera-causing bacteria die in the acidic environ-
ment of the stomach. However, when a person has ingest-
ed food or water containing large amounts of cholera bac-
teria, some will survive to infect the intestines. As would
be expected, antacid usage or the use of any medication
that blocks acid production in the stomach would allow
more bacteria to survive and cause infection.
In the small intestine, the rapidly multiplying bacte-
ria produce a toxin that causes a large volume of water
and electrolytes to be secreted into the bowels and then
to be abruptly eliminated as watery diarrhea. Vomiting
may also occur. Symptoms begin to appear between one
and three days after the contaminated food or water has
been ingested.
Most cases of cholera are mild, but about one in 20
patients experience severe, potentially life-threatening
symptoms. In severe cases, fluids can be lost through
diarrhea and vomiting at the rate of one quart per hour.
This can produce a dangerous state of dehydration
unless the lost fluids and electrolytes are rapidly replaced.
Signs of dehydration include intense thirst, little or no
urine output, dry skin and mouth, an absence of tears,
glassy or sunken eyes, muscle cramps, weakness, and
rapid heart rate. The soft spot on an infantâ€™s head will
appear to be sunken or drawn in. Dehydration occurs most
rapidly in the very young and the very old because they
have fewer fluid reserves. A doctor should be consulted
immediately any time signs of severe dehydration occur.
Immediate replacement of the lost fluids and electrolytes
is necessary to prevent kidney failure, coma, and death.

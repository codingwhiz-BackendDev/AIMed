herbal medicine have also been shown to alleviate some
of the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy and are
being recommended by many doctors.
Certain foods including many vegetables, fruits and
grains are believed to offer protection against various
cancers. However, isolation of the individual constituent
of vegetables and fruits that are anti-cancer agents has
proven difficult. In laboratory studies, vitamins such as
A, C and E, as well as compounds such as isothio-
cyanates and dithiolthiones found in broccoli, cauli-
flower, and cabbage, and beta-carotene found in carrots
have been shown to protect against cancer. Studies have
shown that eating a diet rich in fiber as found in fruits
and vegetables reduces the risk of colon cancer. Exercise
and a low fat diet help control weight and reduce the risk
of endometrial, breast, and colon cancer.
Certain drugs, which are currently being used for
treatment, could also be suitable for prevention. For
example, the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex), which has been
very effective against breast cancer, is currently being
tested by the National Cancer Institute for its ability to
prevent cancer. Similarly, retinoids derived from vitamin
A are being tested for their ability to slow the progression
or prevent head and neck cancers. Certain studies have
suggested that cancer incidence is lower in areas where
soil and foods are rich in the mineral selenium. More tri-
als are needed to explain these intriguing connections.

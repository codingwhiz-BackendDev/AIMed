Expectorants are drugs that make mucus easier to
cough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrate
are the primary ingredients in most over-the-counter
expectorants. However, some studies have shown that in
acute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has the
same thinning effect as taking expectorants.

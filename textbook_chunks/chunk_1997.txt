The signs of CP are not usually noticeable at birth.
Children normally progress through a predictable set of
developmental milestones through the first 18 months of
life. Children with CP, however, tend to develop these
skills more slowly because of their motor impairments,
and delays in reaching milestones are usually the first
symptoms of CP. Babies with more severe cases of CP
are usually diagnosed earlier than others.
Selected developmental milestones, and the ages for
normally acquiring them, are given below. If a child does
not acquire the skill by the age shown in parentheses,
there is some cause for concern.
• sits well unsupported—six months (eight–10 months)
• babbles—six months (eight months)
• crawls—nine months (12 months)
• finger feeds, holds bottle—nine months (12 months)
• walks alone—12 months (15–18 months)
• uses one or two words other than dada/mama—12
months (15 months)
• walks up and down steps—24 months (24–36 months)
• turns pages in books; removes shoes and socks—24
months (30 months)
Children do not consistently favor one hand over the
other before 12–18 months, and doing so may be a sign
that the child has difficulty using the other hand. This
same preference for one side of the body may show up as
asymmetric crawling or, later on, favoring one leg while
climbing stairs.
It must be remembered that children normally
progress at somewhat different rates, and slow beginning
accomplishment is often followed by normal develop-
ment. Other causes for developmental delay—some
benign, some serious—should be excluded before con-

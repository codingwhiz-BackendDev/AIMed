All drugs have the potential to be misused, whether
legally prescribed by a doctor, purchased over-the-
counter at the local drug store, or bought illegally on the
street. Taken in combination with other drugs or with
alcohol, even drugs normally considered safe can cause
death or serious long term consequences. Children are
particularly at risk for accidental overdose, accounting
for over one million poisonings each year from drugs,
alcohol, and other chemicals and toxic substances. Peo-
ple who suffer from depression and who have suicidal
thoughts are also at high risk for drug overdose.

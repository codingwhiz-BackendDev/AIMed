Folic acid supplements are usually prescribed, and
self-care includes avoiding:
• alcohol
• non-herbal tea, antacids, and phosphates (contained in
beer, ice cream, and soft drinks), which restrict iron
absorption
• tobacco
A person with folic acid deficiency anemia should
rest as often as necessary until restored energy levels
make it possible to resume regular activities. A doctor
should be seen if fever, chills, muscle aches, or new
symptoms develop during treatment, or if symptoms do
not improve after two weeks of treatment.

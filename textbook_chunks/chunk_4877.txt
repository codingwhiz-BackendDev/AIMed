Computed tomography, also called CT scan, CAT
scan, or computerized axial tomography, is a combina-
tion of focused x-ray beams and computerized produc-
tion of an image. Introduced in the early 1970s, this radi-
ologic procedure has advanced rapidly and is now widely
used, sometimes in the place of standard x rays.

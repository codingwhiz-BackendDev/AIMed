Excessively loose joints are the hallmark of this EDS
type, formerly known as EDS type III. Both large joints,
such as the elbows and knees, and small joints, such as
toes and fingers, are affected. Partial and total joint dislo-
cations are common, and particularly involve the jaw,
knee, and shoulder. Many individuals experience chronic
limb and joint pain, although x rays of these joints appear
normal. The skin may also bruise easily. Osteoarthritis is
a common occurrence in adults. EDS hypermobility type
is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
There are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS hypermobility type. These include skin involvement
(either hyperextensible skin or smooth and velvety skin)
and generalized joint hypermobility. At this time there is
no test for this form of EDS.

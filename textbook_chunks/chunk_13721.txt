Alternative practitioners offer the same advice as tradi-
tional practitioners concerning diet modification. In addi-
tion they recommend taking charcoal tablets, Lactobacillus
acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and citrus seed
extract. An electrolyte replacement fluid can be made at

sugar to one quart of water. For food poisoning other than
botulism, two homeopathic remedies, either Arsenicum
album or Nux vomica, are strongly recommended.

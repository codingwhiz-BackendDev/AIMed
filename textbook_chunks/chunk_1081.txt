Digestion of food begins in the mouth, moves on to
the stomach, and then into the small intestine. Along the
way, specific enzymes are needed to process different
types of sugars. An enzyme is a substance that acts as a
catalyst to produce chemical changes without being
changed itself. The enzymes lactase, maltase, and isoma-
ltase (or sucrase) are needed to break down the disaccha-
rides; when one or more is inadequate, the result is car-
bohydrate intolerance.

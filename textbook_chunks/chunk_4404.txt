Some children have a very serious primary (first
episode) herpes infection called “gingivostomatitis.” This
causes fever, swollen lymph glands, and numerous blis-
ters inside the mouth and on the lips and tongue that may
form large, open sores. These painful sores may last up
to three weeks and can make eating and drinking diffi-
cult. Because of this, young children with gingivostom-
atitis are at risk for dehydration (excessive loss of water
from the body).
Most people experience fewer than two recurrent
outbreaks of cold sores each year. Some people never
experience outbreaks, while some have very frequent
outbreaks. In most people, the blisters form in the same
area each time and are triggered by the same factors
(such as stress, sun exposure, etc).

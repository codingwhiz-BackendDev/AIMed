Ganciclovir and foscarnet are both antiviral med-
ications that have been used to treat patients with
weak immune systems who develop a serious illness
from CMV (including retinitis). As of 1998, research
is still being done to try to find useful drugs to treat
newborn babies suffering from congenital infection
with CMV. Antiviral drugs are not used to treat
CMV infection in otherwise healthy patients because
the drugs have significant side effects that outweigh
their benefits.

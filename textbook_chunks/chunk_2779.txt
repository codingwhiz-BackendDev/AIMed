Pregnant women, particularly those in the first or
second trimester, should not have chest x rays unless
absolutely necessary. If the exam is ordered, women who
are, or could possibly be, pregnant must wear a protec-
tive lead apron. Because the procedure involves radia-
tion, care should always be taken to avoid overexposure,
particularly for children. However, the amount of radia-
tion from one chest x ray procedure is minimal.

Catheter—A rubber or plastic tube placed through
the urethra into the bladder to remove excess
urine when the flow of urine is cut off, or to pre-
vent urinary infection.
Creatinine—One of the “waste” substances nor-
mally excreted by the kidneys into the urine.
When urine flow is slowed, creatinine may collect
in the blood and cause toxic effects.
Hyperplasia—A condition where cells, such as
those making up the prostate gland, rapidly divide
abnormally and cause the organ to become
enlarged.
Hypertrophy—A technical term for enlargement,
as in BPH (benign prostatic hypertrophy).
Urethra—In males, the tube that conducts urine
from the bladder through the penis to the outside
of the body. When narrowed by an enlarging
prostate, symptoms of BPH develop.
Urinary retention—The result of progressive
obstruction of the urethra by an enlarging prostate,
causing urine to remain in the bladder even after
urination.
Alternatives to TUR, some only recently introduced,
include:
• Laser ablation of the prostate. Laser energy is applied
to the prostate through a special fiber passed through a
cystoscope. The procedure is done in an operating
room, and several patients have retained urine postoper-
atively.
• Transurethral incision of the prostate. Less invasive
than standard TUR, an incision is made through the
prostate to open up the part of the urethra passing
through it. This may work well in men whose prostate
is not grossly enlarged.
• Transurethral vaporization. A small roller ball is used to
break up and vaporize the obstructing prostatic tissue,
rather than cutting it away as in standard TUR. This is
equally successful but patients usually can leave the
hospital within 24 hours, and there is less blood loss.
• If the prostate is greatly enlarged—as is the case in
about 5–10% of those diagnosed, an incision is made to
perform an open prostatectomy, removing the entire
gland under direct vision.

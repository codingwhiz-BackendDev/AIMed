Some herbal preparations can be useful for diaper
rash. Calendula reduces inflammation, tightens tissues,
and disinfects. It has been recommended for seborrheic
dermatitis as well as for general inflammation of the
skin. The ointment should be applied at each diaper
change. Chickweed ointment can also be soothing for
irritated skin and may be applied once or twice daily.

Autolytic debridement takes advantage of the bodyâ€™s
own ability to dissolve dead tissue. The key to the tech-
nique is keeping the wound moist, which can be accom-
plished with a variety of dressings. These dressings help
to trap wound fluid that contains growth factors, enzymes,
and immune cells that promote wound healing. Autolytic
debridement is more selective than any other debridement
method, but it also takes the longest to work. It is inappro-
priate for wounds that have become infected.

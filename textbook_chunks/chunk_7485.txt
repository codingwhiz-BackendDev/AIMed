When the body’s fluid supply is severely depleted,
hypovolemic shock is likely to occur. This condition,
which is also called physical collapse, is characterized by
pale, cool, clammy skin; rapid heartbeat; and shallow
breathing.
Blood pressure sometimes drops so low it can not be
measured, and skin at the knees and elbows may become
blotchy. Anxiety, restlessness, and thirst increase. After
the patient’s temperature reaches 107°F (41.7°C) damage
to the brain and other vital organs occurs quickly.

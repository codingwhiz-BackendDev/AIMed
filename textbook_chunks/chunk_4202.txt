The rise in cocaine use as well as the appearance of
crack cocaine in the late 1980s spurred fears about its
effects on the developing fetus and, since then, several
research reports have suggested that prenatal cocaine use
could be associated to a wide range of fetal, newborn,
and child development problems. According to the The
Lindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation, many of
these early reports had methodological flaws, and most
researchers nowadays propose more cautious conclu-
sions concerning prenatal cocaine effects. Much evi-
dence would seem to point to the lack of quality prenatal
care and the use of alcohol and tobacco as primary fac-
tors in poor fetal development among pregnant cocaine
users. Research sponsored by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Albert Einstein Medical
Center in Philadelphia corroborate the Lindensmith Cen-
ter findings in reporting that the lack of quality prenatal
care is associated with undesirable effects often attrib-
uted to cocaine exposure such as prematurity, low birth
weight, and fetal or infant death. The Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) however, reports that
mothers who use cocaine early in pregnancy are five
times as likely to have a baby with a malformation of the
urinary tract as mothers who do not use the drug. Thus,
cocaine use during pregnancy is assuredly most inadvis-
able, especially since it is also often associated with the
use of alcohol known to cause long-term developmental
problems. Supporting the cocaine-exposed expecting
mother so as to discourage cocaine use remains an
important task for all health caregivers.

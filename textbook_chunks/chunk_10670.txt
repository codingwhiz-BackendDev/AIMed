Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) is a technique in which a hollow tube called an
endoscope is passed through the mouth and stomach to
the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). This
procedure was developed to examine abnormalities of
the bile ducts, pancreas, and gallbladder. It was devel-
oped during the late 1960s and is used today to diagnose
and treat blockages of the bile and pancreatic ducts.

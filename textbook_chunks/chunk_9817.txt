Parents and other adults need to be alert to possible
electric dangers in the home. Damaged electric appliances,
wiring, cords, and plugs should be repaired or replaced.
Electrical repairs should be attempted only by people with
the proper training. Hair dryers, radios, and other electric
appliances should never be used in the bathroom or any-
where else they might accidentally come in contact with
water. Young children need to be kept away from electric
appliances and should be taught about the dangers of elec-
tricity as soon as they are old enough. Electric outlets
require safety covers in homes with young children.
During thunderstorms, people should go indoors
immediately, even if no rain is falling, and boaters should
return to shore as rapidly as possible. People who cannot
reach indoor shelter should move away from metallic
objects such as golf clubs and fishing rods and lie down in
low-ground areas. Standing or lying under or next to tall or
metallic structures is unsafe. An automobile is appropriate
cover, as long as the radio is off. Telephones, computers,
hair dryers, and other appliances that can act as conduits
for lightning should not be used during thunderstorms.

Echinococcosis (Hydatid disease) refers to human
infection by the immature (larval) form of tapeworm,
Echinococcus. One of three forms of the Echinococcus
spp., E. granulosus, lives on dogs and livestock, and
infects humans through contact with these animals. Aller-
gic reactions and damage to various organs from cyst for-
mation are the most common forms of disease in humans.

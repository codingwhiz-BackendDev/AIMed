Antibiotic treatment is the only way to battle this
potentially life-threatening infection. Mild to moderate
cellulitis can be treated with the following antibiotics
taken every four to eight hours by mouth:
• penicillins (Bicillin, Wycillin, Pen Vee, V-Cillin)
• erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ery-Tab)
• cephalexin (Biocef, Keflex)
• cloxacillin (Tegopen)
Other medications may be recommended, such as
acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)
to relieve pain, and aspirin to decrease fever.
A normally healthy person is usually not hospital-
ized for mild or moderate cellulitis. General treatment
measures include elevation of the infected area, rest, and
application of warm, moist compresses to the infected
area. The doctor will want to see the patient again to
make sure that the antibiotic treatment is effective in
stopping the infection.
Persons at high risk for severe cellulitis will proba-
bly be hospitalized for treatment and monitoring. Antibi-
otics may be given intravenously to patients with severe
cellulitis. Complications such as deep infection, or bone
or joint infections, might require surgical drainage and a
longer course of antibiotic treatment. Extensive tissue
destruction may require plastic surgery to repair. In cases
of orbital cellulitis caused by a sinus infection, surgery
may be required to drain the sinuses.

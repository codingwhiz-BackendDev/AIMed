When the blood vessels in the legs (and sometimes
the arms) become narrowed, this can restrict blood flow
and cause pain in the affected area. In severe cases, the
tissue may die, requiring amputation.
The narrowing is usually caused by buildup of fatty
plaques in the vessels, often as the result of smoking,
high blood pressure, or poorly-controlled diabetes melli-
tus. The vessels usually narrow slowly, but itâ€™s possible
for a blood clot to form quickly, causing sudden severe
pain in the affected leg or arm.

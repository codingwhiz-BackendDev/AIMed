In the United States, circumcision in infant boys is
performed for social, medical, or cultural/religious rea-
sons. Once a routine operation urged by pediatricians
and obstetricians for newborns in the middle of the twen-
tieth century, circumcision has become an elective option
that parents make for their sons on an individual basis.
Families who practice Judaism or Islam may select to
have their sons circumcised as a religious practice. Oth-
ers choose circumcision for medical benefits.
Female circumcision (also known as female genital
mutilation) is usually performed for cultural and social

to ensure the virginity of a bride on her wedding day. It
also prevents the woman from achieving sexual pleasure
during coitus. This practice is not universally approved
by the medical profession and is considered by some as a
human rights violation.
Though the incidence of male circumcision has
decreased from 90% in 1979 to 60% in 1996, it is still the
most common surgical operation in the United States.
Circumcision rates are much lower for the rest of the
industrialized world. In Britain, it is only done for reli-
gious practices or to correct a specific medical condition
of the penis.
Some of the medical reasons parents choose cir-
cumcision are to protect against infections of the uri-
nary tract and the foreskin, prevent cancer, lower the
risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases, and pre-
vent phimosis (a tightening of the foreskin that may
close the opening of the penis). Though studies indi-
cate that uncircumcised boys under the age of five are
20 times more likely than circumcised boys to have

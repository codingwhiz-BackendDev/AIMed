Bacteria can cause an infection through small cracks
(fissures) that can develop in the dry skin around the heel
and on other parts of the foot or through corns, calluses,
blisters, hangnails, or ulcers. If not treated, the bacterial
infection can destroy skin, tissue, and bone or spread
throughout the body.
Common sites of diabetic foot infections include the
following:
• blisters, corns, or callouses that bleed beneath the skin
• bunions, hammertoes, or other abnormalities in the
bones of the foot

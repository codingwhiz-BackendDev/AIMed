The cause of BPH is a mystery, but age-related
changes in the levels of hormones circulating in the
blood may be a factor. Whatever the cause, an enlarging
prostate gradually narrows the urethra and obstructs the
flow of urine. Even though the muscle in the bladder wall
becomes stronger in an attempt to push urine through the
smaller urethra, in time, the bladder fails to empty com-
pletely at each urination. The urine that collects in the
bladder can become infected and lead to stone formation.
The kidneys themselves may be damaged by infection or
by urine constantly “backing up.”
When the enlarging prostate gland narrows the ure-
thra, a man will have increasing trouble starting the urine
stream. Because some urine remains behind in the blad-
der, he will have to urinate more often, perhaps two or
three times at night (nocturia). The need to urinate can
become very urgent and, in time, urine may dribble out
to stain a man’s clothing. Other symptoms of BPH are a
weak and sometimes a split stream and general aching or
pain in the perineum (the area between the scrotum and
anus). Some men may have considerable enlargement of
the prostate before even mild symptoms develop.
If a man must strain hard to force out the urine,
small veins in the bladder wall and urethra may rupture,

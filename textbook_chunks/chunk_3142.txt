Alveoli—The small air sacs clustered at the ends
of the bronchioles in the lungs, in which oxygen-
carbon dioxide exchange takes place.
Aspiration—When solids or liquids that should be
swallowed into the stomach are instead breathed
into the respiratory system, or when substances
from the outside environment are accidentally
breathed into the lungs.
Sputum—Material produced within the alveoli in
response to an infectious or inflammatory process.

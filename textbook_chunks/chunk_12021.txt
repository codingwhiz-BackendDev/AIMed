Contact lens wearers must be examined periodical-
ly by their eye doctors to make sure that the lenses fit
properly and that there is no infection. Both infection
and lenses that do not fit properly can damage the
cornea. Patients can be allergic to certain solutions that
are used to clean or lubricate the lenses. For that reason,
patients should not randomly switch products unless
they speak with their doctor. Contact lens wearers
should seek immediate attention if they experience eye
pain, a burning sensation, red eyes, intolerable sensitiv-
ity to light, cloudy vision, or an inability to keep the
eyes open.
To avoid infection, it is important for contact lens
wearers to exactly follow their instructions for lens inser-
tion and removal, as well as cleaning. Soft contact lens
wearers should never use tap water to rinse their lenses or
to make-up solutions. All contact lens wearers should
also always have a pair of glasses and a carrying case for
their contacts with them, in case the contacts have to be
removed due to eye irritation.

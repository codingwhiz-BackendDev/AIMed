Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (also called
coronary artery bypass surgery, CABG, and bypass oper-
ation) is performed to restore blood flow to the heart.
This relieves chest pain and ischemia, improves the
patient’s quality of life, and in some cases, prolongs the
patient’s life. The goals of the procedure are to enable the
patient to resume a normal lifestyle and to lower the risk
of a heart attack.
The decision to perform coronary artery bypass graft
surgery is a complex one, and there is some disagreement
among experts as to when it is indicated. Many experts
feel that it has been performed too frequently in the Unit-
ed States. According to the American Heart Association,
appropriate candidates for coronary artery bypass graft
surgery include patients with blockages in at least three
major coronary arteries, especially if the blockages are in
arteries that feed the heart’s left ventricle; patients with
angina so severe that even mild exertion causes chest
pain; and patients who cannot tolerate percutaneous trans-
luminal coronary angioplasty and do not respond well to
drug therapy. It is well accepted that coronary artery
bypass graft surgery is the treatment of choice for patients
with severe coronary artery disease (three or more dis-
eased arteries with impaired function in the left ventricle).

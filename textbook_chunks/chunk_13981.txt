In North America, frostbite is largely confined to
Alaska, Canada, and the northern states. Recent years
have witnessed a substantial decline in the number of
cases, probably for several reasons, including better win-
ter clothing and footwear and greater public understand-
ing of how to avoid cold-weather dangers. At the same
time, the nature of the at-risk population has changed as
rising numbers of homeless people have made frostbite
an urban as well as a rural public health concern. The
growing popularity of outdoor winter activities has also
expanded the at-risk population.

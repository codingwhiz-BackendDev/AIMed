Child abuse is the blanket term for four types of
child mistreatment: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emo-
tional abuse, and neglect. In many cases children are the
victims of more than one type of abuse. The abusers can
be parents or other family members, caretakers such as
teachers and babysitters, acquaintances (including other
children), and (in rare instances) strangers.

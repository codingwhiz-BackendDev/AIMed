Treating contact dermatitis begins with eliminating
or avoiding the source of irritation. Prescription or over-
the-counter corticosteroid creams can lessen inflamma-
tion and relieve irritation. Creams, lotions, or ointments
not specifically formulated for dermatitis can intensify
the irritation. Oral antihistamines are sometimes recom-
mended to alleviate itching, and antibiotics are pre-
scribed if the rash becomes infected. Medications taken
by mouth to relieve symptoms of dermatitis can make
skin red and scaly and cause hair loss.

of ectopic ACTH syndrome also involves
removing all of the cancerous cells that are producing
ACTH. This may be done through surgery, chemothera-
py (using combinations of cancer-killing drugs), or radi-
ation therapy (using x rays to kill cancer cells), depend-
ing on the type of cancer and how far it has spread. Radi-
ation therapy may also be used on the pituitary (with or
without surgery) for patients who cannot undergo
surgery, or for patients whose surgery did not successful-
ly decrease pituitary release of ACTH.
There are a number of drugs that are effective in
decreasing adrenal production of cortisol. These medica-
tions include mitotane, ketoconazole, metyrapone,
trilostane, aminoglutethimide, and mifepristone. These
drugs are sometimes given prior to surgery in an effort to
reverse the problems brought on by cortisol excess. How-
ever, the drugs may also need to be administered after
surgery (sometimes along with radiation treatments) in
patients who continue to have excess pituitary production
of ACTH.
Because pituitary surgery can cause ACTH levels to
drop too low, some patients require short-term treatment
with a cortisol-like medication after surgery. Patients
who need adrenal surgery may also require glucocorti-
coid replacement. If the entire adrenal gland has been
removed, the patient must take oral glucocorticoids for
the rest of his or her life.

Aerobic bacteria—Bacteria that require oxygen to
live and grow.
Anaerobic bacteria—Bacteria that require the
absence of oxygen to live and grow.
CT scan (computed tomography scan)—Cross-
sectional x rays of the body are compiled to create
a three-dimensional image of the body’s internal
structures.
Debridement—Surgical procedure in which dead
or dying tissue is removed.
Dermis—The deepest layer of skin.
Fascia, deep—A fibrous layer of tissue that
envelopes muscles.
Fascia, superficial—A fibrous layer of tissue that
lies between the deepest layer of skin and the sub-
cutaneous fat.
Gangrene—An extensive area of dead tissue.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy—A treatment in which
the patient is placed in a chamber and breathes
oxygen at higher-than-atmospheric pressure. This
high-pressure oxygen stops bacteria from growing
and, at high enough pressure, kills them.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—An imaging
technique that uses a large circular magnet and
radio waves to generate signals from atoms in the
body. These signals are used to construct images of
internal structures.
Necrosis—Abnormal death of cells, potentially
caused by disease or infection.
Subcutaneous—Referring to the area beneath the
skin.

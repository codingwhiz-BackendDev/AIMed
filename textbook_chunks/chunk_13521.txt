Fluoroquinolones may interact with other medi-
cines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who takes fluoroquinolones should let
the physician know all other medicines he or she is tak-
ing. Among the drugs that may interact with fluoro-
quinolones are:
• antacids that contain aluminum, calcium, or magnesium
• medicines that contain iron or zinc, including multivita-
min and mineral supplements
• sucralfate (Carafate)
• caffeine
• blood thinning drugs such as warfarin (Coumadin)
• airway opening drugs (bronchodilators) such as amino-
phylline, theophylline (Theo-Dur and other brands), and
oxtriphylline (choledyl and other brands)
• didanosine (Videx), used to treat HIV infection.
The list above does not include every drug that may
interact with fluoroquinolones. Be sure to check with a
physician or pharmacist before combining fluoro-
quinolones with any other prescription or nonprescrip-
tion (over-the-counter) medicine.

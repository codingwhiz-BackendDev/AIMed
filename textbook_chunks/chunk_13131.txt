gia has helped promote the validity of this disease.
In 1990, the America College of Rheumatology
developed standards for fibromyalgia that health care
practitioners can use to diagnose this condition. Accord-
ing to these standards, a person is thought to have
fibromyalgia if he or she has widespread pain in combi-
nation with tenderness in at least 11 of the 18 sites
known as trigger points. Trigger point sites include the
base of the neck, along the backbone, in front of the hip
and elbow, and at the rear of the knee and shoulder.

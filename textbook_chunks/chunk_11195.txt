As in any blood test, standard precautions should be
performed to prevent infection at the site where the blood
is obtained, and to prevent excess bleeding. Normally,
the site is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid prior to the
blood being obtained; a sterile non-reusable needle and
syringe are used; and, once the needle is removed, pres-
sure is placed at the site until bleeding has stopped.

Both ophthalmologists and optometrists may detect
and monitor cataract growth and prescribe prescription
lenses for visual deficits. However, only an ophthalmolo-
gist can perform cataract extraction.
Cataracts are easily diagnosed from the reporting of
symptoms, a visual acuity exam using an eye chart, and
by examination of the eye itself. Shining a penlight into
the pupil may reveal opacities or a color change of the
lens even before visual symptoms have developed. An
instrument called a slit lamp is basically a large micro-
scope. This lets the doctor examine the front of the eye
and the lens. The slit lamp helps the doctor determine the
location of the cataract.
Some other diagnostic tests may be used to deter-
mine if cataracts are present or how well the patient may
potentially see after surgery. These include a glare test,
potential vision test, and contrast sensitivity test.

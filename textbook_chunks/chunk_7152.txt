Consequences of a CMV infection can be devastating
in a pregnant woman, a transplant patient, or a person
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Antibody
screening helps control the infection risk for these groups.
In a healthy, nonpregnant person, CMV infection is
almost never serious. Symptoms, if present, are mild,
often resembling infectious mononucleosis due to
Epstein-Barr virus. Antibody screening distinguishes
between these two infections.

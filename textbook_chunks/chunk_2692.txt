A chest x ray is usually done before the chest
drainage tube is inserted. Sometimes fluid becomes
trapped in isolated spaces in the lung, and it is necessary
to do an ultrasound to determine where to locate the
drainage tube. Computed tomography scans (CT) are
useful in locating small pockets of fluids caused by can-
cer or tuberculosis.

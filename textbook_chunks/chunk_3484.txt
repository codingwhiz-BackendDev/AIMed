Patients who are scheduled for a lipid profile test
should fast (except for water) for 12–14 hours before the
blood sample is drawn. If the patient’s cholesterol is to
be fractionated, he or she should also avoid alcohol for
24 hours before the test.
Patients should also stop taking any medications that
may affect the accuracy of the test results. These include
corticosteroids, estrogen or androgens, oral contracep-
tives, some diuretics, haloperidol, some antibiotics, and
niacin. Antilipemics are drugs that lower the concentra-
tion of fatty substances in the blood. When these are
taken by the patient, blood testing may be done frequent-
ly to evaluate the liver function as well as lipids. The
patient’s doctor will give the patient a list of specific
medications to be discontinued before the test.

Like many other upper respiratory diseases, diphthe-
ria is most likely to break out during the winter months.
At one time it was a major childhood killer, but it is now
rare in developed countries because of widespread
immunization. Since 1988, all confirmed cases in the
United States have involved visitors or immigrants. In
countries that do not have routine immunization against
this infection, the mortality rate varies from 1.5â€“25%.
Persons who have not been immunized may get
diphtheria at any age. The disease is spread most often by
droplets from the coughing or sneezing of an infected
person or carrier. The incubation period is two to seven
days, with an average of three days. It is vital to seek
medical help at once when diphtheria is suspected,
because treatment requires emergency measures for
adults as well as children.

Carbohydrate intolerance can be primary or sec-
ondary. Primary deficiency is caused by an enzyme defect
present at birth or developed over time. The most common
is lactose intolerance. Secondary deficiencies are caused
by a disease or disorder of the intestinal tract, and disap-
pear when the disease is treated. These include protein
deficiency, celiac disease, and some intestinal infections.
Adult lactose intolerance is the most common of all
enzyme deficiencies, and it is estimated that 30â€“50 mil-
lion Americans have this condition. Some racial and eth-
nic populations are affected more than others. Lactose
intolerance is found in as many as 75% of African Ameri-
cans, Jewish Americans, Mexican Americans, and Native
Americans, and in 90% of Asian Americans. Descendants
of Northern Europeans and some Mediterranean peoples
usually do not develop the condition. Deficiencies in
enzymes other than lactase are extremely rare.

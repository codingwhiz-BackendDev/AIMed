The fingertips are specialized areas of the hand with
highly developed sensory and manipulative functions.
Large sensory and motor areas located in the brain regu-
late the precise and delicate functions of fingertips. The
fingertip is the site where extensor and flexor tendons
insert. Fingertip injuries are extremely common since the
hands hold a wide array of objects. In 2001, the approxi-
mately 10% of all accidents in the United States referred
for Emergency Room consults involve the hand. Hand
injuries are frequently the result of job injuries and
account for 11–14% of on-the-job injuries and 6% of
compensation paid injuries. Injury to the nail bed occurs
in approximately 15–24% of fingertip injuries.
Fingertip injuries can result in amputation or tissue
loss. The injury is assessed whether the bone and underly-
ing tissue are intact and the size of the wound area. The
pulp is the area of skin opposite the fingernail and is usu-
ally very vulnerable to injury. Pulp injuries commonly
occur in persons who use or are in close contact with fast
moving mechanical devices. These injuries can crush, cut,
and puncture. The fingertips can also be injured by com-
mon crushing accidents. This could cause the develop-
ment of a subungal hematoma (an accumulation of blood
under the nail). At the base of the distal phalanx (the first
circular skin fold from the tip) injuries can occur that can
fracture the underlying bone in the area. Quite commonly

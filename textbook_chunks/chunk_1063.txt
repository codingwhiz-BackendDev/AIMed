Alternative therapies for canker sores are aimed at
healing existing sores and preventing their recurrence.
Several herbal remedies, including calendula (Calendula
officinalis), myrrh (Commiphora molmol), and gold-
enseal (Hydrastis canadensis), may be helpful in the
treatment of existing sores. Compresses soaked in teas
made from these herbs are applied directly to the sores.
The tannic acid in a tea bag can also help dry up the sores
when the wet tea bag is used as a compress. Taking dan-
delion (Taraxacum officinale) tea or capsules may help
heal sores and also prevent future outbreaks. Since
canker sores are often brought on by stress, such stress-
relieving techniques as meditation, guided imagery,
and certain acupressure exercises may help prevent
canker sores or lessen their severity.

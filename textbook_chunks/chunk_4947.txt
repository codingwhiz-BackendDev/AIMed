These symptoms may last from several minutes to
several hours. More severe or longer-lasting symptoms
may indicate more severe brain injury. The person with a
concussion may or may not lose consciousness from the
blow; if so, it will be for several minutes at the most.
More prolonged unconsciousness indicates more severe
brain injury.
The severity of concussion is graded on a three-point
scale, used as a basis for treatment decisions.

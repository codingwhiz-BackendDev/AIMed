A cardiologist may recommend an EP study when
the standard EKG, Holter monitor, event recorder, stress
test, echocardiogram, or angiogram cannot provide
enough information to evaluate an abnormal heart
rhythm, called an arrhythmia.
An EP study also may be beneficial in diagnosing a
suspected arrhythmia in a patient who shows symptoms
of an arrhythmia but in whom it could not be detected
from other tests.
The purpose and great value of an EP study is that it
offers more detailed information to the doctor about the
electrical activity in the heart than the aforementioned
noninvasive tests because electrodes are placed directly
on heart tissue. This allows the electrophysiologist to
determine the specific location of an arrhythmia and,
oftentimes, correct it during the same procedure. This
corrective treatment is permanent and considered a cure,
and, in many cases, the patient may not need to take heart
medications.

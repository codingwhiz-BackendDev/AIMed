dried herb. Steep in 1 pt (0.47 l) of boiled, unchlorinated
water for 10–15 minutes. Strain and cover. Drink warm,

A tincture is the usual method to prepare a concen-
trated form of the herbal remedy. Tinctures, properly pre-
pared and stored, will retain medicinal potency for two
years or more. Combine 4 oz (114 g) of finely cut fresh
or powdered dry herb with 1 pt (0.47 l) of brandy, gin, or
vodka in a glass container. The alcohol should be enough
to cover the plant parts and have a 50/50 ratio of alcohol
to water. Place the mixture away from light for about two
weeks, shaking several times each day. Strain and store
in a tightly capped, dark glass bottle. A standard dose is
0.14 oz (4 ml ) of the tincture three times a day.

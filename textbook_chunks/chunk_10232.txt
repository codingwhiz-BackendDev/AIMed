Gas emboli result from the compression of respira-
tory gases into the blood and other tissues due to rapid
changes in environmental pressure, for example, while
flying or scuba diving. As external pressure decreases,
gases (like nitrogen) that are dissolved in the blood and
other tissues become small bubbles that can block blood
flow and cause organ damage.

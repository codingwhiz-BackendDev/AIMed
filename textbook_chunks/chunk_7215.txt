In newborn infants, the nasolacrimal duct may fail to
form an openingâ€”a condition called dacryostenosis. The
cause of dacryocystitis in adults is usually associated
with inflammation and infection in the nasal region.
Dacryocystitis can be acute, having a sudden onset, or it
can be chronic, with symptoms occurring over the course
of weeks or months. Symptoms of acute dacryocystitis
can include pain, redness, tearing, and swelling at the
inner corner of the eye by the nose. In chronic dacryocys-
titis, the eye area may be swollen, watery or teary, and,
when pressure is applied to the area, there may be a dis-
charge of pus or mucus through the punctum.

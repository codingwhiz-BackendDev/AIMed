Chorionic villus sampling has been in use since the
1980s. This prenatal testing procedure involves taking a
sample of the chorion frondosum—that part of the chori-
onic membrane containing the villi—for laboratory
analysis. The chorionic membrane is the outer sac which
surrounds the developing fetus. Chorionic villi are
microscopic, finger-like projections that emerge from the
chorionic membrane and eventually form the placenta.
The cells that make up the chorionic villi are of fetal ori-
gin so laboratory analysis can identify any genetic, chro-
mosomal, or biochemical diseases of the fetus.
Chorionic villus sampling is best performed
between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. The procedure is
performed either through the vagina and the cervix
(transcervically) or through the abdomen (transabdomi-
nally) depending upon the preferences of the patient or
the doctor. In some cases, the location of the placenta
dictates which method the doctor uses. Both methods are
equally safe and effective. Following the preparation
time, both procedures take only about five minutes.
Women undergoing chorionic villus sampling may expe-
rience no pain at all or feel cramping or pinching. Occa-
sionally, a second sampling procedure must be per-
formed if insufficient villus material was obtained.
For the transcervical procedure, the woman lies on
an examining table on her back with her feet in stirrups.
The woman’s vaginal area is thoroughly cleansed with an
antiseptic, a sterile speculum is inserted into her vagina
and opened, and the cervix is cleansed with an antiseptic.
Using ultrasound (a device which uses sound waves to
visualize internal organs) as a guide, the doctor inserts a
thin, plastic tube called a catheter through the cervix and
into the uterus. The passage of the catheter through the

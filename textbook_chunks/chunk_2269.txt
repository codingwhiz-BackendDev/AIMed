Cervical spondylosis refers to common age-related
changes in the area of the spine at the back of the neck.
With age, the vertebrae (the component bones of the
spine) gradually form bone spurs, and their shock-
absorbing disks slowly shrink. These changes can alter
the alignment and stability of the spine. They may go
unnoticed, or they may produce problems related to pres-
sure on the spine and associated nerves and blood ves-
sels. This pressure can cause weakness, numbness, and
pain in various areas of the body. In severe cases, walk-
ing and other activities may be compromised.

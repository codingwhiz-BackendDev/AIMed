Similar to all surgical procedures, the cardiac
catheterization test does involve some risks. Complica-
tions that may occur during the procedure include
• cardiac arrhythmias (an irregular heart beat)
• pericardial tamponade (a condition that causes excess
pressure in the pericardium which affects the heart due
to accumulation of excess fluid)
• the rare occurrence of myocardial infarction (heart
attack) or stroke may also develop due to clotting or
plaque rupture of one or more of the coronary or brain
arteries.
Before left-side catheterization is performed, the
anticoagulant medication heparin may be administered.
This drug helps decrease the risk of the development of a
blood clot in an artery (thrombosis) and blood clots trav-
eling throughout the body (embolization).
The risks of the catheterization procedure increase
in patients over the age of 60, those who have severe
heart failure, or persons with serious valvular heart
disease.

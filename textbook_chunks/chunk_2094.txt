The best method of cleaning the external ear is to
wipe the outer opening with a damp washcloth folded over
the index finger, without going into the ear canal itself.
Two techniques have been recommended to prevent ceru-
men from reaccumulating in the ear. The patient may place
two or three drops of mineral oil into each ear once a
week, allow it to remain for two or three minutes, and
rinse it out with warm water; or place two drops of Dome-
boro otic solution in each ear once a week after showering.
Patients who wear hearing aids should have their ears
examined periodically for signs of cerumen accumulation.

Scombroid occurs after eating fish that has not
been properly refrigerated after capture. Unlike ciguat-
era, the toxins linked with scombroid are not contracted
by the fish from its surroundings. Bacteria that are nor-
mally found in fish act directly on a chemical (called
histidine) in the flesh of fish that are not properly
cooled when stored. This interaction produces hista-
mine and other chemicals that cause the illness when
the fish is eaten.

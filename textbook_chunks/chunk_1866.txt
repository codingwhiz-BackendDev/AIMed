Cephalosporins are used to treat infections in different
parts of the bodyâ€”the ears, nose, throat, lungs, sinuses, and
skin, for example. Physicians may prescribe these drugs to
treat pneumonia, strep throat, staph infections, tonsillitis,
bronchitis, and gonorrhea. These drugs will not work for
colds, flu, and other infections caused by viruses.

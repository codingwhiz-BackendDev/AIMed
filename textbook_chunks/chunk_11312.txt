Rh disease and ABO incompatibility disease are
caused when a mother’s immune system produces anti-
bodies against the red blood cells of her unborn child.
The antibodies cause the baby’s red blood cells to be
destroyed and the baby develops anemia. The baby’s
body tries to compensate for the anemia by releasing
immature red blood cells, called erythroblasts, from the
bone marrow.
The overproduction of erythroblasts can cause the
liver and spleen to become enlarged, potentially causing
liver damage or a ruptured spleen. The emphasis on ery-
throblast production is at the cost of producing other
types of blood cells, such as platelets and other factors
important for blood clotting. Since the blood lacks clot-
ting factors, excessive bleeding can be a complication.
The destroyed red blood cells release the blood’s
red pigment (hemoglobin) which degrades into a yellow
substance called bilirubin. Bilirubin is normally pro-
duced as red blood cells die, but the body is only
equipped to handle a certain low level of bilirubin in the
bloodstream at one time. Erythroblastosis fetalis over-
whelms the removal system, and high levels of bilirubin

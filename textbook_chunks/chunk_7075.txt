The patient begins by emptying the bladder as much
as possible. A thin plastic catheter is then slowly inserted
into the urethra until it reaches the bladder. Measure-
ments are taken of the residual urine volume and bladder
pressure. Pressure measurements may require a rectal
probe to account for the contribution of the abdominal
muscles to the pressure recording.
The bladder is then gradually filled with either warm
water, room temperature water, saline solution, carbon diox-
ide gas, or a contrast solution for x-ray analysis, depending
on the type of study being done. The patient is asked to
describe sensations during filling, including temperature
sensations and when the first feeling of bladder fullness
occurs. Once the bladder is completely full, the patient is
asked to begin voiding, and measurements are again made
of pressure and volume, as well as flow rate and pressure.

Fasting isnâ€™t appropriate for everyone and, in some
cases, could be harmful. Any person undertaking a first
fast longer than three days should seek medical supervi-
sion. Those with health conditions should always have
medical support during fasting. Plenty of water should be
taken by fasters since dehydration can occur. Saunas and
sweating therapies are sometimes recommended to assist
detoxification, but should be used sparingly. Those fasting
should significantly slow down their lifestyles. Taking
time off of work is helpful, or at least reducing the work
load. Fasters should also get plenty of rest. Exercise
should be kept light, such as walking and gentle stretching.

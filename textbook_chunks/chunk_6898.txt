Cystic fibrosis affects the bodyâ€™s ability to move salt
and water in and out of cells. This defect causes the lungs
and pancreas to secrete thick mucus, blocking passage-
ways and preventing proper function.
CF affects approximately 30,000 children and young
adults in the United States, and about 3,000 babies are
born with CF every year. CF primarily affects people of
white northern-European descent; rates are much lower
in non-white populations.
Many of the symptoms of CF can be treated with
drugs or nutritional supplements. Close attention to and
prompt treatment of respiratory and digestive complica-
tions have dramatically increased the expected life span
of a person with CF. While several decades ago most
children with CF died by age two, today about half of all
people with CF live past age 31. That median age is
expected to grow as new treatments are developed, and it
is estimated that a person born in 1998 with CF has a
median expected life span of 40 years.

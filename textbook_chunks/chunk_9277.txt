When a person is dyslexic, there is often an unexpect-
ed difference between achievement and aptitude. However,
each person with dyslexia has different strengths and weak-
nesses, although many have unusual talents in art, athletics,
architecture, graphics, drama, music, or engineering. These
special talents are often in areas that require the ability to
integrate sight, spatial skills, and coordination.
Often, a person with dyslexia has a problem translat-
ing language into thought (such as in listening or read-
ing), or translating thought into language (such as in
writing or speaking).

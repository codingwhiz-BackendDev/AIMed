Severe dehydration can require hospitalization and
intravenous fluid replacement. If an individualâ€™s blood
pressure drops enough to cause or threaten the develop-
ment of shock, medical treatment is usually required. A
doctor should be notified whenever an infant or child
exhibits signs of dehydration or a parent is concerned
that a stomach virus or other acute illness may lead to
dehydration.

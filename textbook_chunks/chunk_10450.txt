A close-up view of an infected artificial heart valve showing
bacterial endocarditis (the granulated tissue at center of
image).When infection occurs early after surgery, it is likely
that organisms have gained entry during the operative peri-
od.This type of infection is usually caused by Staphylococ-

or red spots on the skin, resulting from hemorrhages
under the skinâ€™s surface. Tiny hemorrhages resembling
splinters may also appear under the fingernails or toe-
nails. If emboli become lodged in the blood vessels of
the lungs, they may cause coughing or shortness of
breath. Emboli lodged in the brain may cause symp-
toms of a mini-stroke, such as numbness, weakness, or
paralysis on one side of the body or sudden vision loss
or double vision. Emboli may also damage the kidneys,
causing blood to appear in the urine. Sometimes the cap-
illaries on the surface of the spleen rupture, causing the
spleen to become enlarged and tender to the touch. Any-
one experiencing any of these symptoms should seek
medical help immediately.

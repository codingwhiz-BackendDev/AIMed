Corns and calluses are one of the three major foot
problems in the United States. The other two are foot
infections and toenail problems. Corns and calluses
affect about 5% of the population.
Corns usually appear on non-weight-bearing areas
like the outside of the little toe or the tops of other toes.
Women have corns more often than men, probably
because women wear high-heeled shoes and other shoes
that do not fit properly. Corns have hard cores shaped
like inverted pyramids. Sharp pain occurs whenever
downward pressure is applied, and a dull ache may be
felt at other times.
Calluses occur most often on the heels and balls of
the feet, the knees, and the palms of the hands. However,
they can develop on any part of the body that is subject to
repeated pressure or irritation. Calluses are usually more
than an inch wide—larger than corns. They generally
don’t hurt unless pressure is applied.

The exact cause of diabetic neuropathy is not
known. Researchers believe that the process of nerve
damage is related to high glucose concentrations in the
blood that could cause chemical changes in nerves, dis-
rupting their ability to effectively send messages. High
blood glucose is also known to damage the blood vessels
that carry oxygen and other nutrients to the nerves. In
addition, some people may have a genetic predisposition
to develop neuropathy.
There is a wide range of symptoms associated with
diabetic neuropathy, and they depend on which nerves
and parts of the body affected and also on the type of
neuropathy present. Some patients have very mild symp-
toms, while others are severely disabled.

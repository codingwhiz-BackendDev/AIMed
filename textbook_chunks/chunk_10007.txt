HYPERKALEMIA. Hyperkalemia may be caused by
ketoacidosis (diabetic coma), myocardial infarction
(heart attack), severe burns, kidney failure, fasting,
bulimia nervosa, gastrointestinal bleeding, adrenal
insufficiency, or Addison’s disease. Diuretic drugs,
cyclosporin, lithium, heparin, ACE inhibitors, beta
blockers, and trimethoprim can increase serum potassi-
um levels, as can heavy exercise. The condition may also
be secondary to hypernatremia (low serum concentra-
tions of sodium). Symptoms may include:
• weakness
• nausea and/or abdominal pain
• irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
• diarrhea
• muscle pain
HYPOKALEMIA. Severe dehydration, aldosteronism,
Cushing’s syndrome, kidney disease, long-term diuretic
therapy, certain penicillins, laxative abuse, congestive
heart failure, and adrenal gland impairments can all
cause depletion of potassium levels in the bloodstream. A
substance known as glycyrrhetinic acid, which is found
in licorice and chewing tobacco, can also deplete potassi-
um serum levels. Symptoms of hypokalemia include:
• weakness
• paralysis
• increased urination
• irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
• orthostatic hypotension
• muscle pain
• tetany

In catatonic stupor, motor activity may be reduced to
zero. Individuals avoid bathing and grooming, make little
or no eye contact with others, may be mute and rigid, and
initiate no social behaviors. In catatonic excitement the
individual is extremely hyperactive although the activity
seems to have no purpose. Violence toward him/herself
or others may also be seen.
NMS is observed as a dangerous side effect associat-
ed with certain neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs such as
haloperidol (Haldol). It comes on suddenly and is char-
acterized by stiffening of the muscles, fever, confusion
and heavy sweating.
Catatonia can also be categorized as intrinsic or
extrinsic. If the condition has an identifiable cause, it is
designated as extrinsic. If no cause can be determined
following physical examination, laboratory testing, and
history taking, the illness is considered to be intrinsic.

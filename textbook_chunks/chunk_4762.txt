The common cold is a viral infection of the upper
respiratory system, including the nose, throat, sinuses,
eustachian tubes, trachea, larynx, and bronchial tubes.
Although over 200 different viruses can cause a cold,
30â€“50% are caused by a group known as rhinoviruses.
Almost all colds clear up in less than two weeks without
complications.

The physician or nurse will begin by assessing the
need for debridement. The wound will be examined, fre-
quently by inserting a gloved finger into the wound to
estimate the depth of dead tissue and evaluate whether it
lies close to other organs, bone, or important body fea-
tures. The area may be flushed with a saline solution
before debridement begins, and a topical anesthetic gel
or injection may be applied if surgical or mechanical
debridement is being performed.

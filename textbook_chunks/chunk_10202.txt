The side effects of DEC almost all are due to the
body’s natural allergic reactions to the dying parasites
rather than to the DEC itself. For this reason, DEC must

These side effects usually occur within the first few days
of treatment. These side effects usually subside as the
individual continues taking the drug.
There is an alternate treatment plan for the use of

reduce allergic reactions to the dead microfilariae and
dying adult worms within the body). Lower doses of DEC
are taken for the first few days, followed by the higher
dose of 2 mg/kg per day for the remaining three weeks. In
addition, steroids may be prescribed to prevent the indi-
vidual’s body from reacting severely to the dead worms.
Another drug used is Ivermectin. Early research
studies of Ivermectin show that it is excellent in killing

The outcome of the cardiac rehabilitation program
depends on a number of variables, including patient fol-
low-through, type and degree of heart disease, and the
availability of an adequate support network for the
patient. Patients who successfully complete the program
will ideally reach an age-appropriate level of physical
activity and be able to return to the workforce and/or
other daily activities.

This test is performed on patients who may have
malfunctioning adrenal glands. Blood and urine cortisol,
together with the determination of adrenocorticotropic

the investigation of Cushing’s syndrome (caused by an
overproduction of cortisol) and Addison’s disease
(caused by the underproduction of cortisol).

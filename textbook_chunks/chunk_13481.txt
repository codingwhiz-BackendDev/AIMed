Diagnosis of fluke infections is based on a combina-
tion of the patient’s history, particularly travel or resi-
dence in areas known to have flukes, and identification of
the fluke’s eggs or adult forms. In some patients, the eggs
are found in fluid from the lungs, bile duct, or small
intestine. Samples of these fluids can be obtained with a
suction instrument (aspirator). Because most types of
fluke infections are rare in the United States, stool speci-
mens or body fluid samples may need to be sent to a lab-
oratory with experts in unusual diseases or conditions to
identify the specific parasite. In some cases, adult flukes
may be found in the patient’s stools, vomit, sputum, or
skin lumps (for lung flukes). In the case of lung flukes, it
is important for the doctor to rule out tuberculosis as a
possible diagnosis. A tuberculosis skin test and chest x
ray will usually be sufficient to do this.

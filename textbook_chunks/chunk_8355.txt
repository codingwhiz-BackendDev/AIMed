related to any diarrheal illness are often
those associated with any injury to the gastrointestinal
tract, such as fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal
pain. All or none of these may be present depending on
the disease causing the diarrhea. The number of bowel
movements can vary—up to 20 or more per day. In some
patients, blood or pus is present in the stool. Bowel
movements may be difficult to flush (float) or contain
undigested food material.
The most common causes of acute diarrhea are
infections (the cause of traveler’s diarrhea), food
poisoning, and medications. Medications are a fre-
quent and often over-looked cause, especially antibi-
otics and antacids. Less often, various sugar free
foods, which sometimes contain poorly absorbable
materials, cause diarrhea.
Chronic diarrhea is frequently due to many of the
same things that cause the shorter episodes (infections,
medications, etc.); symptoms just last longer. Some
infections can become chronic. This occurs mainly with
parasitic infections (such as Giardia) or when patients
have altered immunity (AIDS).
The following are the more usual causes of chronic
diarrhea:
• AIDS
• colon cancer and other bowel tumors
• endocrine or hormonal abnormalities (thyroid, diabetes
mellitus, etc.)
• food allergy
• inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and
ulcerative colitis)
• lactose intolerance
• malabsorption syndromes (celiac and Whipple’s dis-
ease)
• other (alcohol, microscopic colitis, radiation, surgery)

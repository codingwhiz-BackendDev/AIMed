The drug decribed here, oxytocin, makes the uterus
(womb) contract. Physicians use it to deliberately start
labor. Because there are some risks with using oxytocin,
this should be done only when there are good medical
reasons. Any woman who is being given oxytocin should
make sure she has discussed the benefits and risks with
her physician.
Oxytocin also may be used to control bleeding after
delivery or to help make the milk flow in women who are
breastfeeding their babies.

The EEG readings of patients with epilepsy or other
seizure disorders display bursts or spikes of electrical activ-
ity. In focal epilepsy, spikes are restricted to one hemi-
sphere of the brain. If spikes are generalized to both hemi-
spheres of the brain, multifocal epilepsy may be present.
The diagnostic brainwave patterns of other disorders
varies widely. The appearance of excess theta waves
(four to eight cycles per second) may indicate brain
injury. Brain wave patterns in patients with brain disease,
mental retardation, and brain injury show overall slow-
ing. A trained medical specialist should interpret EEG
results in the context of the patientâ€™s medical history, and
other pertinent medical test results.

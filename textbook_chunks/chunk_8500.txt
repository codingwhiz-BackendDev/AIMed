Seeing a physician regularly while taking digitalis
drugs is very important. The physician will check to
make sure the medicine is working as it should and will
make any necessary changes in dosage or in instructions
for taking the medicine.
Patients taking digitalis drugs should learn to take
their pulse and should check it regularly while under
treatment with this medicine. Changes in pulse rate,
rhythm, or force could be signs of side effects.
Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly without
checking with the physician who prescribed it. This
could cause a serious change in heart function.
Digitalis drugs are responsible for many accidental
poisonings in children. Keep this medicine out of the
reach of children.
Be alert to the signs of overdose. Overdosing is a
serious concern with digitalis drugs, because the amount
of medicine that most people need to help their heart
problems is very close to the amount that can cause prob-
lems from overdose. If any of these signs of overdose
occur, check with a physician as soon as possible:
• loss of appetite
• nausea
• vomiting

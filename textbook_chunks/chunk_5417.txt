This needleless form of acupuncture is said to relax
the abdomen, ease discomfort, and stimulate regular bowel
movements when diet and exercise fail to do so. After lying
down, the patient closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.
For two minutes, he applies gentle fingertip pressure to a
point about two and one-half inches below the navel.
Accupressure can also be applied to the outer edges
of one elbow crease and maintained for 30 seconds
before pressing the crease of the other elbow. This should
be done three times a day to relieve constipation.

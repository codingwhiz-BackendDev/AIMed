Thousands of natural and man-made substances can
cause contact dermatitis, which is the most common skin
condition requiring medical attention and the foremost
source of work-related disease. Florists, domestic work-
ers, hairdressers, food preparers, and employees in
industry, construction, and health care are the people
most at risk of contracting work-related contact dermati-
tis. Americans spend roughly $300 million a year in their
quest for relief from contact dermatitis, not counting the
considerable sums devoted by governments and business-
es to regulating and policing the use of skin-threatening
chemicals in the workplace. But exactly how many peo-
ple suffer from contact dermatitis remains unclear; a 1997
article in the Journal of the American Medical Associa-
tion notes that figures ranging from 1% to 15% have been
put forward for Western industrial nations.

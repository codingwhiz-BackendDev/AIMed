Diagnosing cocaine addiction can be difficult.
Many of the signs of short-term cocaine use are not
obvious. Since cocaine users often also use other drugs,
it may not be easy to distinguish the effects of one drug
from another.
Cocaine use has been documented in significant
numbers of eighth graders as well as older teens. Over all
age groups, more men than women use the drug. The
highest rate of cocaine use is found among adults 18 to
25 years old.

Patients will typically be evaluated by imaging stud-
ies, blood analysis, physical examination, and health
improvement. These follow-up visits usually occur at spe-
cific time intervals during the course of treatment. Surgi-
cal patients may require closer observation during the ini-
tial post-operative period to avoid potential complica-
tions. Reconstructive surgery can be considered to
improve appearance and restore function. Certain surgical
procedures (such as flaps and microsurgery of blood ves-
sels) can restore new tissues to a previous surgery site.

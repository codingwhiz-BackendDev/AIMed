Derealization is a dissociative symptom in which the
external environment is perceived as unreal. The patient
may see walls, buildings, or other objects as changing in
shape, size, or color. In some cases, the patient may feel
that other persons are machines or robots, though the
patient is able to acknowledge the unreality of this feeling.

An estimated one in 2,000 babies are born with all
or part of a limb missing, ranging from a missing part of
a finger to the absence of both arms and both legs. Con-
genital amputation is the least common reason for
amputation. However, there are occasional periods in
history where the number of congenital amputations
increased. For example, the thalidomide tragedy of the
early 1960s occurred after pregnant mothers in western
Europe were given a tranquilizer containing the drug.
The result was a drastic increase in the number of babies
born with deformed limbs. In this example, the birth
defect usually presented itself as very small, deformed
versions of normal limbs. More recently, birth defects as
a result of radiation exposure near the site of the Cher-
nobyl disaster in Russia have left numerous children
with malformed or absent limbs.

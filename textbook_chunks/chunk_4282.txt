The most common symptom of coccydynia, irre-
spective of the cause of the condition, is pain when sit-
ting, or when rising from a sitting position. If the condi-
tion lasts long enough, the patient may even experience
pain when standing or lying down. Sometimes, numb-
ness occurs in the lower part of the spine. Some patients
will experience pain during bowel movements, sexual
intercourse, or menstruation.
Secondary symptoms include back pain from sitting
in odd positions in order to relieve pain, and painful feet
from standing too much, because patients avoid sitting.

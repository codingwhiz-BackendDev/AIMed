Ophthalmologists and optometrists, who treat eye
disorders, are well qualified to diagnose corneal abra-
sions. The doctor will check the patientâ€™s vision (visual
acuity) in both eyes with an eye chart. A patient history
will also be taken, which may help to determine the
cause of the abrasion. A slit lamp, which is basically a
microscope and light source, will allow the doctor to see
the abrasion. Fluorescein, a yellow dye, may be placed
into the eye to determine the extent of the abrasion. The
fluorescein will temporarily stain the affected area.

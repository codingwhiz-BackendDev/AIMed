CPR is performed to restore and maintain breathing
and circulation and to provide oxygen and blood flow to
the heart, brain, and other vital organs. CPR should be
performed if a person is unconscious and not breathing.
Respiratory and cardiac arrest can be caused by allergic
reactions, an ineffective heartbeat, asphyxiation, breath-
ing passages that are blocked, choking, drowning, drug
reactions or overdoses, electric shock, exposure to cold,
severe shock, or trauma. CPR can be performed by
trained bystanders or healthcare professionals on infants,
children, and adults. It should always be performed by
the person on the scene who is most experienced in CPR.

In a typical face lift surgery, the surgeon begins by making
an incision within the hairline just above the ear.The inci-
sion continues down along the front of the ear, around the
earlobe, and then up and behind the ear extending back
into the hairline, as shown above.The same procedure is
repeated on the other side of the face.The surgeon will
then separate the skin from the tissue, remove fat deposits
over the cheeks and neck, tighten up muscles and tissues
below the chin and upwards behind the neck.The surgeon
then trims excess skin from the original incision, pulls the
skin back, and sutures it into place. (Illustration by Electronic

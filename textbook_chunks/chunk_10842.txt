protozoal infections. Routine stool cultures, however,
cannot be used to identify any of the four types of E. coli
that cause intestinal infections. ETEC, EPEC, and EIEC
are unusual in the United States and can usually be iden-
tified only by specialists in research laboratories.
Because of concern about EHEC outbreaks, however,
most laboratories in the United States can now screen for
O157:H7 with a test that identifies its characteristic
toxin. All patients with bloody diarrhea should have a
stool sample tested for E. coli O157:H7.

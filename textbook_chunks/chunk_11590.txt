Treatment for this condition is primarily aimed at
alleviating symptoms. Physicians direct the patient to eat
a bland diet, to chew his or her food thoroughly, and to
drink water after eating to clean out the pouches. If the
condition is severe, several types of surgery are available
to remove the pouches and repair the defects. If a pouch
is due to a stenosis (narrowing) in the esophagus it may
be possible to relieve it by passing a dilator through it, a
process called bougeinage.

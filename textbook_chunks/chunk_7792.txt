Dysthymic disorder
Dysthymia commonly occurs in tandem with other
psychiatric and physical conditions. Up to 70% of dys-
thymic patients have both dysthymic disorder and major
depressive disorder, known as double depression. Sub-
stance abuse, panic disorders, personality disorders,
social phobias, and other psychiatric conditions are also
found in many dysthymic patients. Dysthymia is prevalent
in patients with certain medical conditions, including mul-
tiple sclerosis, AIDS, hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue
syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, and post-car-
diac transplantation. The connection between dysthymic
disorder and these medical conditions is unclear, but it
may be related to the way the medical condition and/or its
pharmacological treatment affects neurotransmitters. Dys-
thymic disorder can lengthen or complicate the recovery
of patients also suffering from medical conditions.
Along with an underlying feeling of depression,
people with dysthymic disorder experience two or more
of the following symptoms on an almost daily basis for a
period for two or more years (most suffer for five years),
or one year or more for children:
• under or overeating
• insomnia or hypersomnia
• low energy or fatigue
• low self-esteem
• poor concentration or trouble making decisions
• feelings of hopelessness

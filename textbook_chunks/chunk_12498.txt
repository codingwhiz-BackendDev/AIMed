heart as energy. It is at this point in the fast that sensa-
tions of hunger generally go away, and many people
experience normal or even increased energy levels. Hor-
mone levels and certain functions become more stable in
this state as well. The goal of most fasts is to allow the
body to reach the ketosis state in order to burn excess fat
and unneeded or damaged tissue. Thus, fasts longer than
three days are generally recommended as therapy.
Weight loss occurs most rapidly during the first few
days of a fast, up to 2 pounds per day. In following days,
the figure drops to around 0.5 pound per day. An average
weight loss of a pound a day for an entire fast can be
expected.

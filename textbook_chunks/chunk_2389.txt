T. cruzi is carried by insects or bugs known as redu-
viid or “kissing bugs.” These insects are very common in
Central and South America where they inhabit poorly
constructed houses and huts. The insects deposit their
waste material, exposing inhabitants to the parasites. The
parasites then enter the body by way of a cut or via the
eyes or mouth. T. cruzi can also be transmitted by blood
transfusion. Eating uncooked, contaminated food or
breastfeeding can also transmit the disease. The reduvi-
ids, in turn, become infected with the parasite by biting
infected animals and humans.

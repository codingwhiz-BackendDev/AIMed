develop emphysema as well. In emphysema, shortness of
breath on exertion is the predominant early symptom.
Coughing is usually minor and there is little sputum. As
the disease progresses, the shortness of breath occurs
with less exertion, and eventually may be present even
when at rest. At this point, a sputum-producing cough
may also occur. Either chronic bronchitis or emphysema
may lead to respiratory failureâ€”a condition in which
there occurs a dangerously low level of oxygen or a seri-
ous excess of carbon dioxide in the blood.

Fecal incontinence can result from a wide variety of
medical conditions, including childbirth-related anal
injuries, other causes of damage to the anus or rectum,
and nervous system problems.
Vaginal-delivery childbirth is a major cause of fecal
incontinence. In many cases, childbirth results in damage
to the anal sphincter, which is the ring of muscle that
closes the anus and keeps stools within the rectum until a
person can find an appropriate opportunity to defecate.
Nerve injuries during childbirth may also be a factor in
some cases. An ultrasound study of first-time mothers
found sphincter injuries in 35%. About one-third of the
injured women developed fecal incontinence or an
uncontrollable and powerful urge to defecate (urgency)
within six weeks of giving birth. Childbirth-related
incontinence is usually restricted to gas, but for some
women involves the passing of liquid or solid stools.
The removal of hemorrhoids by surgery or other
techniques (hemorrhoidectomies) can also cause anal
damage and fecal incontinence, as can more complex
operations affecting the anus and surrounding areas. Anal
and rectal infections as well as Crohnâ€™s disease can lead
to incontinence by damaging the muscles that control
defecation. For some people, incontinence becomes a
problem when the anal muscles begin to weaken in
midlife or old age.
Dementia, mental retardation, strokes, brain tumors,
multiple sclerosis, and other conditions that affect the ner-
vous system can cause fecal incontinence by interfering
with muscle function or the normal rectal sensations that
trigger sphincter contraction and are necessary for
bowel control. One study of multiple sclerosis patients
discovered that about half were incontinent. Nerve
damage caused by long-lasting diabetes mellitus (dia-
betic neuropathy) is another condition that can give
rise to incontinence.

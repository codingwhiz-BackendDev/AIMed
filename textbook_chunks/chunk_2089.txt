Irrigation is the most common method of removing
impacted cerumen. It involves washing out the ear canal
with water from a commercial irrigator or a syringe with
a catheter attached. Although some doctors use Water
Piks to remove cerumen, most do not recommend them
because the stream of water is too forceful and may dam-
age the eardrum. The doctor may add a small amount of
alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other antiseptic. The
water must be close to body temperature; if it is too cold
or too warm, the patient may feel dizzy or nauseated.
After the ear has been irrigated, the doctor will apply
antibiotic ear drops to protect the ear from infection.
Irrigation should not be used to remove cerumen if
the patientâ€™s eardrum is ruptured or missing; if the patient
has a history of chronic otitis media (inflammation of
the middle ear) or a myringotomy (cutting the eardrum to
allow fluid to escape from the middle ear); or if the
patient has hearing in only one ear.
If irrigation cannot be used or fails to remove the
cerumen, the patient is referred to an ear, nose, and throat
(ENT) specialist. The specialist can remove the wax with
a vacuum device or a curette, which is a small scoop-
shaped surgical instrument.
Some doctors prescribe special ear drops, such as
Cerumenex, to soften the wax. The most common side
effect of Cerumenex is an allergic skin reaction. Over-
the-counter wax removal products include Debrox or
Murine Ear Drops. A 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide
may also be used. These products are less likely to irri-
tate the skin of the ear.

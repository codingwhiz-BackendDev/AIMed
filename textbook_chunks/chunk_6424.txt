Croup is a common childhood ailment. Typically, it
arises from a viral infection of the larynx (voice box) and
is associated with mild upper respiratory symptoms such
as a runny nose and cough. The key symptom is a harsh
barking cough. Croup is usually not serious, and most
children recover within a few days. In a small percentage
of cases, a child develops breathing difficulties and may
need medical attention.

Once the diagnosis has been confirmed by biopsy,
the clinical stage of the cancer is assigned. Using the
characteristics of the primary tumor, its depth of penetra-
tion through the bowel, and the presence or absence of
regional or distant metastases, the stage of the cancer is
derived. Often, the depth of penetration through the
bowel or the presence of regional lymph nodes can’t be
assigned before surgery.
Colon cancer is assigned stages I through IV based
on the following general criteria:
• Stage I: the tumor is confined to the epithelium or has
not penetrated through the first layer of muscle in the
bowel wall.
• Stage II: the tumor has penetrated through to the outer
wall of the colon or has gone through it, possibly invad-
ing other local tissue.
• Stage III: any depth or size of tumor associated with
regional lymph node involvement.

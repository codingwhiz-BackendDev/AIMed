FMF could be described as a disorder of “inappro-
priate” inflammation. That is, an event that in a normal
situation causes a mild or unnoticeable inflammation
might cause a severe inflammatory response in someone
with FMF. Certain areas of the body are at risk for FMF-
related symptoms. A serosa is a serous (fluid-producing)
membrane that can be found inside the abdominal cavity
(peritoneum), around the lungs (pleura), around the heart
(pericardium), and inside the joints (synovium). The
symptoms of FMF are due to inflammation of one or
more of the serosal membranes (serositis). Thus, FMF is
also sometimes called recurrent polyserositis.
During an attack, large numbers of neutrophils, a
type of white blood cell, move into the affected areas

The cold agglutinins test is used to confirm the diag-
nosis of certain diseases that stimulate the body to pro-
duce cold agglutinins. The disease most commonly diag-
nosed by this test is mycoplasmal pneumonia, but
mononucleosis, mumps, measles, scarlet fever, some
parasitic infections, cirrhosis of the liver, and some
types of hemolytic anemia can also cause the formation
of cold agglutinins. Hemolytic anemias are conditions in
which the blood is low in oxygen because the red blood
cells are breaking down at a faster rate than their normal
life expectancy of 120 days. In addition to these illness-
es, some people have a benign condition called chronic
cold agglutinin disease, in which exposure to cold causes
temporary clumping of red blood cells and consequent
numbness in ears, fingers, and toes.

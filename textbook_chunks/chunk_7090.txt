Inability of the bladder to relax during filling, or low
bladder volume, may indicate interstitial cystitis, prostate
enlargement, or bladder cancer. Contraction of the blad-
der during filling may be due to irritation from infection
or cysts, obstruction of the bladder outlet, or neurological
disease such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord
injury. Diminished sensation may occur with nerve
lesions, peripheral neuropathy, or chronic overfilling.

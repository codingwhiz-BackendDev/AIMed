Genetic counseling is recommended for parents of
children with DiGeorge syndrome because the disorder
can be detected prior to birth. Although most children
with DiGeorge syndrome did not inherit the chromosome
deletion from their parents, they have a 50% chance of
passing the deletion on to their own children.
Because of the association between DiGeorge syn-
drome and fetal alcohol syndrome, pregnant women
should avoid drinking alcoholic beverages.

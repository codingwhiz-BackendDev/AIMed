Amphetamines have a high potential for abuse. They
should be used in weight reduction programs only when
alternative therapies have been ineffective. Administra-
tion for prolonged periods may lead to drug dependence.
These drugs are classified as schedule II under federal
drug control regulations.
The amphetamines and their cogeners are con-
traindicated in advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomatic
cardiovascular disease, and moderate to severe hyper-
tension and hyperthyroidism. They should not be used
to treat patients with hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to
the sympathomimetic amines, or with glaucoma, a histo-
ry of agitated states, a history of drug abuse, or during
the 14 days following administration of monoamine oxi-
dase (MAO) inhibitors.
Methylphenidate may lower the seizure threshold.
Benzphetamine is category X during pregnancy.
Diethylpropion is category B. Other anorexiants have not
been rated; however their use during pregnancy does not
appear to be advisable. Safety for use of anorexiants has
not been evaluated.
Amphetamines are all category C during pregnancy.
Breastfeeding while receiving amphetamines is not rec-
ommended because the infant may experience withdraw-
al symptoms.
There have been reports that when used in children,
methylphenidate and amphetamines may retard growth.
Although these reports have been questioned, it may be
suggested that the drugs not be administered outside of
school hours (because most children have behavior prob-
lems in school), in order to permit full stature to be
attained.
The most common adverse effects of CNS stimulants
are associated with their primary action. Typical respons-
es include overstimulation, dizziness, restlessness, and
similar reactions. Rarely, hematologic reactions, includ-
ing leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and bone marrow
depression have been reported. Lowering of the seizure
threshold has been noted with most drugs in this class.

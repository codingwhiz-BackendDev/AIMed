Testing during pregnancy to determine whether an
unborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing in a
family has identified a specific CMT-causing mutation.
This can be done after 10â€“12 weeks of pregnancy using a
procedure called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS
involves removing a tiny piece of the placenta and exam-
ining the cells. Testing can also be done by amniocente-
sis after 16 weeks gestation by removing a small amount
of the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzing
the cells in the fluid. Each of these procedures has a small
risk of miscarriage associated with it, and those who are
interested in learning more should check with their doctor
or genetic counselor. Couples interested in these options
should obtain genetic counseling to carefully explore all
of the benefits and limitations of these procedures.

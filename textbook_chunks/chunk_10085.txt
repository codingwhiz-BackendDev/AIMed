Muscles are stimulated by signals from nerve cells
called motor neurons. This stimulation causes electrical
activity in the muscle, which in turn causes contraction.
This electrical activity is detected by a needle electrode
inserted into the muscle and connected to a recording
device. Together, the electrode and recorder are called an
electromyography machine. EMG can determine whether
a particular muscle is responding appropriately to stimu-
lation, and whether a muscle remains inactive when not
stimulated.
EMG is performed most often to help diagnose dif-
ferent diseases causing weakness. Although EMG is a
test of the motor system, it may help identify abnormali-
ties of nerves or spinal nerve roots that may be associated
with pain or numbness. Other symptoms for which EMG
may be useful include numbness, atrophy, stiffness, fas-
ciculation, cramp, deformity, and spasticity. EMG results
can help determine whether symptoms are due to a mus-
cle disease or a neurological disorder, and, when com-
bined with clinical findings, usually allow a confident
diagnosis.
EMG can help diagnose many muscle and nerve dis-
orders, including:
• muscular dystrophy
• congenital myopathies
• mitochondrial myopathies

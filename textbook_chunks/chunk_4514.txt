Alternative therapies have not been studied in a
large-scale, scientific way. Large doses of vitamins,
fiber, and green tea are among therapies tried. Avoiding
cigarettes and alcohol may be helpful. Before initiating
any alternative therapies, the patient is wise to consult
his/her physician to be sure that these therapies do not
complicate or interfere with the established therapy.

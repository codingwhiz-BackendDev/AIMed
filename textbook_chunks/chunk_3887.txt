After circumcision, the wound should be washed
daily. An antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly may be
applied to the site. If there is an incision, a wound dress-
ing will be present and should be changed each time the
diaper is changed. Sometimes a plastic ring is used
instead of a bandage. The ring will usually fall off in five
to eight days. The penis will heal in seven to 10 days.
Infants who undergo circumcision may be fussy for
some hours afterward, so parents should be prepared for
crying, feeding problems, and sleep problems. Generally
these go away within a day. In older boys, the penis may be
painful, but this will go away gradually. A topical anesthet-
ic ointment or spray may be used to relieve this temporary
discomfort. There may also be a “bruise” on the penis,
which typically goes away with no particular attention.

Failure of an unborn child (fetus) to develop proper-
ly results in birth defects. Many of these defects involve
organs that do not function, or function only incidentally,
before birth, and, as a result, go undetected until the baby
is born. In this case, the digestive tract is unnecessary for
fetal growth, since all nutrition comes from the mother
through the placenta and umbilical cord.
During fetal development, the esophagus and the tra-
chea arise from the same original tissue. Normally, the
two tubes would form separately (differentiate); howev-
er, in cases of esphageal atresia and tracheoesophageal
fistulas, they do not, resulting in various malformed con-
figurations. The most common configuration is the “C”
type, in which the upper part of the esophagus abruptly
ends in a blind pouch, while the lower part attaches itself
to the trachea. This configuration occurs in 85–90% of
cases. Esophageal atresia without involvement of the tra-
chea occurs in only 8% of cases.

The patient is usually admitted to the hospital the
day before the coronary artery bypass graft surgery is
scheduled. Coronary angiography has been previously
performed to show the surgeon where the arteries are
blocked and where the grafts might best be positioned.
The patient is given a blood-thinning drug—usually
heparin—that helps to prevent blood clots. The evening
before the surgery, the patient showers with antiseptic
soap and is shaved from chin to toes. After midnight,
food and fluids are restricted. A sedative is prescribed on
the morning of surgery and sometimes the night before.
Heart monitoring begins.

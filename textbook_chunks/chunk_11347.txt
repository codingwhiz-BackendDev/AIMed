The ESR test is a simple test dating back to the
ancient Greeks. A specific amount of diluted, unclotted
blood is placed in a special narrow tube and left undis-
turbed for exactly one hour. The red cells settle towards
the bottom of the tube, and the pale yellow liquid (plas-
ma) rises to the top. After 60 minutes, measurements are
taken of the distance the red cells traveled to settle at the
bottom of the tube. Two methods, the Westergren and the
Wintrobe, are used by laboratories; each method pro-
duces slightly different results. Most laboratories use the
Westergren method.
Normally red cells donâ€™t settle far toward the bottom
of the tube. Many diseases make extra or abnormal pro-
teins that cause the red cells to move close together, stack
up, and form a column (rouleaux). In a group, red cells
are heavier and fall faster. The faster they fall, the further
they settle, and the higher the ESR.
The ESR test is covered by insurance when medical-
ly necessary. Results are usually available the same or
following day.

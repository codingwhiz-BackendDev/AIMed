The most significant risk associated with administra-
tion of glucocorticoids is suppression of natural corticos-
teroid secretion. When the hormones are administered,
they suppress the secretion of ACTH, which in turn
reduces the secretion of the natural hormones. The extent
of suppression varies with dose, drug potency, duration of
treatment, and individual patient response. While suppres-
sion is seen primarily with drugs administered systemical-
ly, it can also occur with topical drugs such as creams and
ointments, or drugs administered by inhalation. Abrupt
cessation of corticosteroids may result in acute adrenal cri-
sis (Addisonian crisis) that is marked by dehydration
with severe vomiting and diarrhea, hypotension, and loss
of consciousness. Acute adrenal crisis is potentially fatal.
Chronic overdose of glucocorticoids leads to Cushin-
goid syndrome, which is clinically identical to Cushingâ€™s
syndrome and differs only in that in Cushingoid, the
excessive steroids are from drug therapy rather than
excessive glandular secretion. Symptoms vary, but most
people have upper body obesity, rounded face, increased
fat around the neck, and thinning arms and legs. In its
later stages, this condition leads to weakening of bones
and muscles with rib and spinal column fractures.
The short term adverse effects of corticosteroids are
generally mild, and include indigestion, increased
appetite, insomnia, and nervousness. There are also a
very large number of infrequent adverse reactions, the
most significant of which is drug induced-paranoia.
Delerium,
depression,
menstrual irregularity,
and
increased hair growth are also possible. Consult detailed
reviews for further information.
Long-term use of topical glucocorticoids can result
in thinning of the skin. Oral steroid inhalations may cause

Patients who take monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAO inhibitors) should be aware that the co-adminis-
tration of products containing dextromethorphan can
cause dizziness, fainting, fever, nausea, and possibly
coma. Do not take dextromethorphan unless a physician
permits the use of the two drugs together.
When dextromethorphan is taken with medicines
that cause drowsiness, this effect may be enhanced.

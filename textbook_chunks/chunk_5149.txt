Meningomyelocele may be treated with surgery to
close the open portion of the spinal cord. Surgery for
encephalocele is possible only if there is a minimal
amount of brain tissue protruding. Malformations associ-
ated with hydrocephalus (Dandy-Walker, Chiari II, and
some cases of hydranencephaly) may be treated by
installation of a drainage shunt for cerebrospinal fluid.
Drugs may be used to treat some symptoms of brain
defects, including seizures and spasticity.

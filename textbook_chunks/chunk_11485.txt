Surgery to correct esophageal atresia is usually suc-
cessful. Post-operative complications may include diffi-
culty swallowing, since the esophagus may not contract
efficiently, and gastrointestinal reflux, in which the
acidic contents of stomach back up into the lower part of
the esophagus, possibly causing ulcers.

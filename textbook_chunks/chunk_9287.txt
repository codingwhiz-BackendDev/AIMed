Anyone who is suspected to have dyslexia should
have a comprehensive evaluation, including hearing,
vision, and intelligence testing. The test should include
all areas of learning and learning processes, not just
reading.
As further research pinpoints the genes responsible
for some cases of dyslexia, there is a possibility that ear-
lier testing will be established to allow for timely inter-
ventions to prevent the onset of the condition and to treat
it when it does occur.
Unfortunately, in many schools, a child is not identi-
fied as having dyslexia until after repeated failures.

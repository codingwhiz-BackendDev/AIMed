Chorionic villus sampling is performed on pregnant women who are at risk for carrying a fetus with a genetic or chromoso-
mal defect.This procedure can be performed through the vagina and the cervix (transcervically) or through the abdomen
(transabdominally). In the transcervical procedure, as depicted above, the physician uses ultrasound to help guide a catheter
through the cervix into the uterus. By applying suction from the syringe attached to the other end of the catheter, a small
sample of the chorionic villi are obtained. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
cervix may cause cramping. The doctor carefully watch-
es the image produced by the ultrasound and advances
the catheter to the chorionic villi. By applying suction
from the syringe attached to the other end of the catheter,
a small sample of the chorionic villi are obtained. A
cramping or pinching feeling may be felt as the sample is
being taken. The catheter is then easily withdrawn.
For the transabdominal method, the woman lies on
her back on an examining table. Ultrasound enables the
doctor to locate the placenta. The specific area on the
woman’s abdomen is cleansed thoroughly with an anti-
septic and a local anesthetic may be injected to numb the
area. With ultrasound guidance, a long needle is inserted
through the woman’s abdominal wall, through the uterine
wall and to the chorionic villi. The sample is obtained by
applying suction from the syringe.
The chorionic villus sample is immediately placed
into nutrient medium and sent to the laboratory. At the lab-

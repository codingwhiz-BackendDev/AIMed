Until the 1970s, patients with symptoms related to
disease of the bile ducts or pancreas frequently needed
surgery to diagnose the cause and treat any abnormali-
ties. ERCP allowed physicians for the first time to obtain
high quality x rays of the common bile and pancreatic
ducts, and detect areas of narrowing (strictures), stones,
and tumors. ERCP was not initially designed for treat-
ment. ERS was developed shortly after and enabled
physicians to treat the abnormalities identified by the
injection of dye and x rays.
The revolutionary technique made possible the
endoscopic removal of stones and stretching of areas of
narrowing (strictures). It has since been expanded to
include drainage of bile from blocked ducts and treat-
ment of various abnormalities of the pancreas.

A concussion occurs when the head hits or is hit by
an object, or when the brain is jarred against the skull,
with sufficient force to cause temporary loss of function
in the higher centers of the brain. The injured person may
remain conscious or lose consciousness briefly, and is
disoriented for some minutes after the blow. According
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
approximately 300,000 people sustain mild to moderate
sports-related brain injuries each year, most of them
young men between 16 and 25.
While concussion usually resolves on its own with-
out lasting effect, it can set the stage for a much more
serious condition. “Second impact syndrome” occurs
when a person with a concussion, even a very mild one,
suffers a second blow before fully recovering from the
first. The brain swelling and increased intracranial pres-
sure that can result is potentially fatal. More than 20 such
cases have been reported since the syndrome was first
described in 1984.

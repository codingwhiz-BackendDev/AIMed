FSH testing is performed if a physician suspects the
patient may have a disorder involving the reproductive
system or pituitary gland. The pituitary gland produces
FSH, which stimulates the growth of the sacks (follicles)
that surround the eggs in a womanâ€™s ovaries. This is
important for the process of ovulation, in which the egg
is released. In men, FSH stimulates production of sperm.
If there are abnormal levels of FSH in the blood it may
mean that one of several disorders are present. Normal
fluctuations occur as a result of puberty, the menstrual
cycle, pregnancy, and menopause.
The FSH test is performed more often on women than
on men. In women, it is used to determine if menopause
has begun, to diagnose infertility and menstrual disor-
ders (such as anovulatory bleeding), to measure hormone
levels in children who enter puberty at an early age, and to
diagnose other disorders. In men, it can be used to deter-
mine early puberty, abnormal tissue growth on one or more
of the hormone-secreting (endocrine) glands (called multi-
ple endocrine neoplasia), or to diagnose other disorders.

of carpal tunnel syndrome include numb-
ness, burning, tingling, and a prickly pin-like sensation
over the palm surface of the hand, and into the thumb,
forefinger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger.
Some individuals notice a shooting pain which goes from
the wrist up the arm, or down into the hand and fingers.
With continued median nerve compression, an individual
may begin to experience muscle weakness, making it dif-
ficult to open jars and hold objects with the affected
hand. Eventually, the muscles of the hand served by the
median nerve may begin to grow noticeably smaller
(atrophy), especially the fleshy part of the thumb.
Untreated, carpal tunnel syndrome may eventually result
in permanent weakness, loss of sensation, or even paral-
ysis of the thumb and fingers of the affected hand.

Diagnosis of FA involves a careful medical history
and thorough neurological exam. Lab tests include elec-
tromyography, an electrical test of muscle, and a nerve
conduction velocity test. An electrocardiogram may be
performed to diagnose heart arrhythmia.
Direct DNA testing is available, allowing FA to be
more easily distinguished from other types of ataxia. The
same test may be used to determine the presence of the
genetic defect in unaffected individuals, such as siblings.

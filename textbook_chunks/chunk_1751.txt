There are several processes to prepare cells for use.
One form involves extracting cells from the patient they
are to be used on and then culturing them in a laboratory
setting until they multiply to the level needed for trans-
plant back into the patient. Another procedure uses fresh-
ly removed fetal animal tissue, which has been processed
and suspended in a saline solution. The preparation of
fresh cells then may be either injected immediately into
the patient, or preserved by being freeze-dried or deep-
frozen in liquid nitrogen before being injected. Cells may
be tested for pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, or par-
asites, before use.

A delusion is an unshakable belief in something
untrue. These irrational beliefs defy normal reasoning,
and remain firm even when overwhelming proof is pre-
sented to dispute them. Delusions are often accompanied
by hallucinations and/or feelings of paranoia, which
act to strengthen confidence in the delusion. Delusions
are distinct from culturally or religiously based beliefs
that may be seen as untrue by outsiders.

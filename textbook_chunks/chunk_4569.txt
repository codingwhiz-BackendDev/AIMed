A colonoscopy is generally recommended when the
patient complains of rectal bleeding or has a change in
bowel habits and other unexplained abdominal symp-
toms. The test is frequently used to test for colorectal
cancer, especially when polyps or tumor-like growths
have been detected using the barium enema and other
diagnostic tests. Polyps can be removed through the
colonoscope and samples of tissue (biopsies) can be
taken to test for the presence of cancerous cells.
The test also enables the physician to check for
bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohnâ€™s
disease. It is a necessary tool in monitoring patients who
have a past history of polyps or colon cancer.

Chlamydia trachomatis is a major cause of sexually
transmitted diseases (called nongonococcal urethritis
and pelvic inflammatory disease). When a woman with
an active chlamydial infection gives birth to a baby, the
baby may aspirate (suck into his or her lungs) some of
the mother’s bacteria-laden secretions while passing
through the birth canal. This can cause a form of relative-
ly mild pneumonia in the newborn, occurring about two
to six weeks after delivery.
Chlamydia psittaci is a bacteria carried by many
types of birds, including pigeons, canaries, parakeets, par-
rots, and some gulls. Humans acquire the bacteria through
contact with dust from bird feathers, bird droppings, or
from the bite of a bird carrying the bacteria. People who
keep birds as pets or who work where birds are kept have
the highest risk for this type of pneumonia. This pneumo-
nia, called psittacosis, causes fever, cough, and the pro-
duction of sputum containing pus. This type of pneumo-
nia may be quite severe, and is usually more serious in
older patients. The illness can last several weeks.
Chlamydia pneumoniae usually causes a type of rel-
atively mild “walking pneumonia.” Patients experience
fever and cough. This type of pneumonia is called a
“community-acquired pneumonia” because it is easily
passed from one member of the community to another.

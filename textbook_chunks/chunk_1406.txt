The patient will be asked to lie down, with the neck
fully extended and the head turned away from the side
being massaged. While watching an electrocardiogram
monitor, the doctor will gently touch the carotid sinus. If
there is no change in the heart rate on the monitor, the
pressure is applied more firmly with a gentle rotating
motion. After massaging one side of the neck, the mas-
sage will be repeated on the other side. Both sides of the
neck are never massaged at the same time.

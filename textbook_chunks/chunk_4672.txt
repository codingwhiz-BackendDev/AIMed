Severe stenosis may require surgery for reshaping the
stoma.
â€¢ Parastomal hernia (bowel causing bulge in the abdomi-
nal wall next to the stoma). This is due to placement of
the stoma where the abdominal wall is weak or creation
of an overly large opening in the abdominal wall. The
use of an ostomy support belt and special pouching
supplies may be adequate. If severe, the defect in the
abdominal wall should be repaired and the stoma
moved to another location.

Maintaining a close and open relationship with a
partner is one way to avoid the emotional pain and isola-
tion that can lead to sexual dysfunction. Additionally,
women should learn if any medications they take affect
sexual function, and should refrain from alcohol and
drugs and quit smoking. Women who have anxieties and
fears about sexual intercourse, whether because of earlier
abuse, rape, or a prudish upbringing, should deal with
those issues through therapy.

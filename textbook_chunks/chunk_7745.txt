The purpose of these hormones is to prevent preg-
nancy; they are about 99% effective in achieving this
goal. No hormonal contraceptive methods provide protec-
tion from AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases.
Depo-Provera and Lunelle are given as an injection
and work in several ways to prevent conception. First,
the egg (ovum) is prevented from maturing and being
released. The mucus in the cervix (opening into the
uterus or womb) becomes thicker, making it difficult for
the sperm to enter. Depo-Provera and Lunelle also cause
the lining of the uterus to become thinner, making
implantation of a fertilized egg unlikely.
An injection of Depo-Provera or Lunelle must be
given within the first five days of a normal period. Depo-
Provera provides protection against pregnancy for three
months, while Lunelle provides similar protection for
one month. Ovulation (release of a mature egg) typically
occurs within 60 days of the last injection of Lunelle,
about twice as fast after use of Depo-Provera. Also,
because Lunelle is a combined hormone contraceptive as
opposed to progestin-only Depo-Provera and Norplant, it
is less likely to cause irregular or absent menstruation.
Norplant capsules contain a synthetic hormone that
is slowly released over a period of up to five years. It
functions like Depo-Provera in that it prevents the
ovaries from producing ova (eggs) and also results in
thicker mucus in the cervix, which prevents the sperm
from passing through the cervix. Norplant can be insert-
ed at any time.

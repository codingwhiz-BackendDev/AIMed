Patients with celiac disease must adhere to a strict
GFD throughout their lifetime. Once the diet has been
followed for several years, individuals with celiac dis-
ease have similar mortality rates as the general popula-
tion. However, about 10% of people with celiac disease
develop a cancer involving the gastrointestinal tract (both
carcinoma and lymphoma).
There are a small number of patients who develop a
refractory type of celiac disease, where the GFD no
longer seems effective. Once the diet has been thorough-
ly assessed to ensure no hidden sources of gluten are
causing the problem, medications may be prescribed.
Steroids or immunosuppressant drugs are often used to
try to control the disease. It is unclear whether these
efforts meet with much success.

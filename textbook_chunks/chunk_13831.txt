Surgical risks of fracture repair are greater in
patients over 60 years of age because the bones often tak-
ing longer to heal properly. Obesity may place extra
stress on the healing site, affecting healing and possibly
risking reinjury. Smoking may slow the healing process
after fracture repair, as well as poor nutrition, alco-
holism, and chronic illness. Some medications may
affect the fracture site, causing poor union. Such medica-
tions include anti-hypertensives and cortisone.
Possible complications following fracture repair
include excessive bleeding, improper fit of joined bone
ends, pressure on nearby nerves, delayed healing, and a
permanent incomplete healing of the fracture. If there is
a poor blood supply to the fractured site with one of the
portions of broken bone not properly supplied by the
blood, the bony portion will die and healing of the frac-
ture will not take place. This is called aseptic necrosis.
Poor immobilization of the fracture from improper cast-
ing which permits motion between the bone parts may
prevent healing and repair of the bone with possible
deformity. Infection can interfere with bone repair. This
risk is greater in the case of a compound fracture (a bone
fracture causing an open wound) where ideal conditions
are present for severe streptococcal and staphylococcal
infections. Occasionally, fractured bones in the elderly
may possibly never heal properly. The risk is increased
when nutrition is poor.

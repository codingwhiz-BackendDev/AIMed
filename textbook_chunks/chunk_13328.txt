Flesh-eating disease has a fatality rate of about 30%.
Diabetes, arteriosclerosis, immunosuppression, kidney
disease, malnutrition, and obesity are connected with a

users may also be at higher risk. The infection site also
has a role. Survivors may require plastic surgery and may
have to contend with permanent physical disability and
psychological adjustment.

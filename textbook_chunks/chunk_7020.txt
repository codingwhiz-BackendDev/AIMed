Hemorrhagic cystitis, which is marked by large
quantities of blood in the urine, is caused by an acute
bacterial infection of the bladder. In some cases, hemor-
rhagic cystitis is a side effect of radiation therapy or
treatment with cyclophosphamide. Hemorrhagic cystitis
in children is associated with adenovirus type 11.

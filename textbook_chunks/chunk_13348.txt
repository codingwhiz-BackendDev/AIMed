Flower remedies are more homeopathic than herbal
in the way they work, effecting energy levels rather than
chemical balances. They have been described as “liquid
energy.” The theory is that they encapsulate the flowers’
healing energy, and are said to deal with and overcome
negative emotions, and so relieve blockages in the flow
of human energy that can cause illness.

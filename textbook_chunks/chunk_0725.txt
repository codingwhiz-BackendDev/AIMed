Dehydration is the most common complication.
Especially at the extremes of age, this should be watched
for and treated with either Oral Rehydration Solution or
intravenous fluid replacement.
Infection may also involve areas outside the intes-
tine. This is unusual, except for infections with C. fetus.
C. fetus infections tend to occur in those who have dis-
eases of decreased immunity such as AIDS, cancer, etc.
This subtype is particularly adapted to protect itself from
the body’s defenses.
Areas outside the intestine that may be involved are:
• Nervous system involvement either by direct infection
of the meninges (outer covering of the spinal and brain)
or more commonly by producing the Guillain-Barré
syndrome (progressive and reversible paralysis or
weakness of many muscles). In fact, Campylobacter
may be responsible for 40% of the reported cases of
this syndrome.

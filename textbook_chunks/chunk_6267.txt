Elevation of CK-I may be seen in stroke, extreme
shock, or brain tumor.
Elevation of CK-II is seen after a myocardial infarc-
tion. It begins to rise three to six hours after the heart
attack, and may peak within 24 hours. It should then
return to normal. For this reason, it is a useful marker for
recent myocardial infarction, but not for one which
occurred more than a day before the test.
Elevation of CK-III indicates skeletal muscle dam-
age. This may occur from normal exercise, trauma, or
muscle disease. CK levels may be very high early on in
muscular dystrophy, but may fall to normal later as
muscle tissue is lost. Elevated CK is also seen in myosi-
tis, myoglobinuria, toxoplasmosis, and trichinosis.
Hypothyroidism may also cause elevated CK.

A violent movement at the joint that exceeds normal
limits usually causes a joint dislocation. Although dislo-
cations often result from trauma, they sometimes occur
as a result of disease affecting the joint structures. In the
process of the dislocation, there is tearing of the liga-
ments and the articular capsule, which are vital structures
for connecting the bone. Following a dislocation, the
bones affected are often immobile and the affected limb
may be locked in an abnormal position; fractures are
also a concern with severe dislocations.
Important factors in recognizing a dislocation or
subluxation include a history of experiencing a fall or
receiving a blow in a particular joint followed by the sud-
den onset of loss of function to the involved limb. Imme-
diately after the dislocation, the joint almost always
swells significantly and feels painful when pressure is
applied (point tenderness). If trauma to the joint causing
the dislocation or subluxation is violent in nature, small
chips of bone can be torn away with the supporting struc-
tures. Chronic recurrent dislocations may take place
without severe pain because of the somewhat slack con-
dition of the surrounding muscles and other supporting
tissues. A first-time dislocation is considered and treated
as a possible fracture. Risk factors that can increase sus-
ceptibility of joint dislocation and subluxation are shal-
low or abnormally formed joint surfaces present at birth
(congenital) and/or other diseases of ligaments and tissue
around a joint. Some infants are born with a hip disloca-
tion. Both sexes and all ages are affected.

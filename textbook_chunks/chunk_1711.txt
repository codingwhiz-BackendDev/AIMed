A very serious infection, called orbital cellulitis,
occurs when bacteria enter and infect the tissues sur-
rounding the eye. In 50â€“70% of all cases of orbital cel-
lulitis, the infection spreads to the eye(s) from the sinus-
es or the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat). Twen-
ty-five percent of orbital infections occur after surgery on
the face. Other sources of orbital infection include a
direct infection from an eye injury, from a dental or
throat infection, and through the bloodstream.
Infection of the tissues surrounding the eye causes
redness, swollen eyelids, severe pain, and causes the eye
to bulge out. This serious infection can lead to a tempo-
rary loss of vision, blindness, brain abscesses, inflamma-
tion of the brain and spinal tissues (meningitis), and
other complications. Before the discovery of antibiotics,
orbital cellulitis caused blindness in 20% of patients and
death in 17% of patients. Antibiotic treatment has signif-
icantly reduced the incidence of blindness and death.

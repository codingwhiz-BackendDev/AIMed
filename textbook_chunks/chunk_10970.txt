As noted above, enterovirus is capable of attacking
many different organs and producing a variety of symp-
toms. Most infections are mild and improve without
complications, and require no specific therapy. When the
virus attacks critical organs however, such as the heart,
respiratory muscles, nervous system, etc., then special-
ized care is often needed.
As of 2001, no effective antiviral medication for
enterovirus has undergone investigation in patients,
though some drugs appear promising for the future. In
some patients who are unable to produce antibodies
(hypogammaglobunemia), administrating antibodies
themselves is helpful.

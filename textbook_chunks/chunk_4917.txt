CT provides the ability to see and measure the thick-
ness of the aortal wall, which is very helpful in diagnos-
ing aortic aneurysms. The use of contrast will help see
details within the aorta. In addition, density can identify
calcification, and this helps differentiate between acute
and chronic problems. An abnormal CT scan may indi-
cate signs of aortic clots. Aortic rupture is suggested by
signs such as a hematoma around the aorta or the escape
of blood from its cavity.

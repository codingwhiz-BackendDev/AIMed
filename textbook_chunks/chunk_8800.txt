Seeing a physician regularly while taking a diuretic
is important. The physician will check to make sure the
medicine is working as it should and will watch for
unwanted side effects.
Some people feel unusually tired when they first
start taking diuretics. This effect usually becomes less
noticeable over time, as the body adjusts to the medicine.
Because diuretics increase urine output, people who
take this medicine may need to urinate more often, even
during the night. Health care professionals can help
patients schedule their doses to avoid interfering with
their sleep or regular activities.

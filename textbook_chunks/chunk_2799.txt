Pneumonia shows up on radiographs as patches and
irregular areas of density (from fluid in the lungs). If the
bronchi, which are usually not visible, can be seen, a
diagnosis of bronchial pneumonia may be made. Shifts or
shadows in the hila (lung roots) may indicate emphysema
or a pulmonary abscess. Widening of the spaces between
ribs suggests emphysema. Other pulmonary diseases may
also be detected or suspected through chest x ray.

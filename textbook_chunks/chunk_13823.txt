broken ends of the bone are set, the affected area is
immobilized for several weeks and kept rigid with a
sling, plaster cast, brace or splint. With the use of trac-
tion, muscle pull on the fracture site is overcome by
weights attached to a series of ropes running over pul-
leys. Strategically implanted electrical stimulation
devices have proven beneficial in healing a fracture site,
especially when the fracture is healing poorly and repair
by other means is difficult.

The prognosis of EB varies depending on the subtype
of the disease. Individuals with EB simplex can live long,
fulfilling lives. The severity of the junctional and dys-
trophic forms of EB can vary greatly. Infants affected with
some forms of the disease often do not survive infancy;
other forms can lead to severe scarring and disfigurement.

Candidiasis is an infection caused by a species of the
yeast Candida, usually Candida albicans. This is a com-
mon cause of vaginal infections in women. Also, Candida
may cause mouth infections in people with reduced
immune function, or in patients taking certain antibiotics.
Candida can be found in virtually all normal people but
causes problems in only a fraction. In recent years, howev-
er, several serious categories of candidiasis have become
more common, due to overuse of antibiotics, the rise of
AIDS, the increase in organ transplantations, and the use of
invasive devices (catheters, artificial joints and valves)—all
of which increase a patient’s susceptibility to infection.

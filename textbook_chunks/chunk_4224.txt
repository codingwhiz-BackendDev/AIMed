Various alternative or complementary approaches
have been used in treating cocaine addiction, often in
combination with more conventional therapies. In Japan,
the herb acorus has been traditionally used both to assist
early-stage cocaine withdrawal and in later recovery
stages. Other herbs sometimes used to treat drug addic-
tions of various kinds include kola nut, guarana seed and
yohimbe (to boost short-term energy), and valerian root,
hops leaf, scullcap leaf, and chamomile (to calm the
patient). The amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine
have been used to reduce cocaine addictsâ€™ craving for the
drug, and vitamin therapy may be used to help strengthen
the patient. Gentle massage has been used to help infants
born with congenital cocaine addiction. Other tech-
niques, such as acupuncture, EEG biofeedback, and
visualization, may also be useful in treating addiction.

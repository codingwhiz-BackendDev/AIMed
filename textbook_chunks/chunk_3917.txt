If the liver loses its ability to remove toxins from the
brain, the patient may have additional symptoms. The
patient may become forgetful and unresponsive, neglect
personal care, have trouble concentrating, and acquire
new sleeping habits. These symptoms are related to
ammonia intoxication and the failure of the liver to con-
vert ammonia to urea. High protein intake in these
patients can also lead to these symptoms.

Removing the fatty deposits restores normal blood
flow to the part of the body supplied by the artery. An
endarterectomy is performed to treat cerebrovascular dis-
ease in which there is a serious reduction of blood supply
to the brain (carotid endarterectomy), or to treat periph-
eral vascular disease (impaired blood supply to the legs).
Endarterectomy is most often performed on one of
the two main arteries in the neck (the carotids) opening
the narrowed arteries leading to the brain. When per-
formed by an experienced surgeon, the practice is
extremely effective, reducing the risk of stroke by up to
70%. Recent studies indicate it is effective in preventing
stroke, even among those patients who had no warning
signs except narrowed arteries detected by their doctors
on a routine exam.

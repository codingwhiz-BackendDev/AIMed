Eyelid edema is most often caused by allergic reac-
tions, for example, allergies to eye makeup, eyedrops or
other drugs, or plant allergens such as pollen. Trichinosis,
a disease caused by eating undercooked meat, also causes
eyelid edema. However, swelling can also be caused by
more serious causes, such as infection, and can lead to
orbital cellulitis which can threaten vision. Symptoms can
include swelling, itching, redness, or pain.

Diets that are low in fruits and vegetables increase
the risk of cervical cancer. Women also have an increased
risk of cervical cancer if their mothers took the drug
diethylstilbestrol (DES) while they were pregnant. This
drug was given to women between 1940 and 1971 to pre-
vent miscarriages. Some statistical studies have suggest-
ed that the long-term use of oral contraceptives may
slightly increase the risk of cervical cancer.

An endoscope as used in the field of gastroenterolo-
gy (the medical study of the stomach and intestines) is a
thin, flexible tube that uses a lens or miniature camera to
view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. When the
procedure is limited to the examination of the inside of
the gastrointestinal tractâ€™s upper portion, it is called
upper endoscopy or esphagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
With the endoscope, the esophagus (swallowing tube),
stomach, and duodenum (first portion of the small intes-
tine) can be easily examined, and abnormalities frequent-
ly treated. Patients are usually sedated during the exam.

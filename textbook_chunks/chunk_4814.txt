As is true of most immunodeficiency disorders, one
of the first signs that the patient has the condition is
recurrent infections. Patients with common variable
immunodeficiency are subject to recurrent infections,
especially those caused by microbes that donâ€™t normally
cause disease in normal persons. The main diagnostic
test that distinguishes common variable immunodeficien-
cy from other immunodeficiency diseases is the low anti-
body level despite the normal number of B cells. Anti-
body levels are tested in the serum by a procedure called
electrophoresis. This procedure both quantifies the
amount of antibody present and identifies the various
classes of antibodies. The main class of antibody for
fighting infectious diseases is IgG.

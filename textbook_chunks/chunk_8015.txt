Diagnosis should be suspected in any patient with
sudden increased thirst and urination. Laboratory exami-
nation of urine will reveal very dilute urine, made up
mostly of water with no solute. Examination of the blood
will reveal very concentrated blood, high in solute and
low in fluid volume.
A water deprivation test may be performed. This test
requires a patient to stop all fluid intake. The patient is
weighed just before the test begins, and urine is collected
and examined hourly. The test is stopped when:
• the patient has lost more than 5% of his or her original
body weight
• the patient has reached certain limits of low blood pres-
sure and increased heart rate
• the urine is no longer changing significantly from one
sample to the next in terms of solute concentration
The next step of the test involves injecting a synthet-
ic form of ADH, with one last urine sample examined 60
minutes later. Comparing plasma and urine osmolality
allows the doctor to diagnose either central DI, nephro-
genic DI, partial DI, or psychogenic polydipsia.

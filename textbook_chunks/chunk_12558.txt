Chinese medicine regards fatigue as a blockage or
misalignment of qi, or energy flow, inside the human
body. The practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses
acupuncture and/or herbal therapy to rebalance the
entire system. The Chinese formula Minot Bupleurum
soup (or Xiao Chia Hu Tang) has been used for nearly
2,000 years for the type of chronic fatigue that comes
after the flu. In this condition, the person has low-grade
fever, nausea, and fatigue. There are other formulas that
are helpful in other cases. Acupuncture involves the
placement of a series of thin needles into the skin at tar-
geted locations on the body known as acupoints in order
to harmonize the energy flow within the human body.

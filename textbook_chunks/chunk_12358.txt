Familial polyposis (FP) is known by many syn-
onyms, most include some combination of words which
reflect what is known about the disease. As the disease is
inherited, the word, family, is often included. Because
these mushroom-like growths are the most obvious mani-
festation of the disorder, the word, polyp, is usually in
the term as well. Adenoma refers to the particular kind of
polyp that is typically discovered. Some of the names
found in medical texts and journals include polyposis
coli, familial colonic polyposis, multiple familial polypo-
sis, familial adenomatous colon polyposis, adenomatosis
of the colon and rectum (ACR), and familial adenoma-
tous polyposis (FAP). The last term and its abbreviation
have been commonly used since the early 1990s. It will
be used in this discussion.
Familial polyposis or familial adenomatous poly-
posis (FAP) is a premalignant disease. This means that
a person with FAP, if left untreated, will invariably
develop cancer. Individuals with this disorder grow
hundreds of polyps throughout their large intestines.
The polyps, which may also be called adenomas, com-
monly develop just after puberty. Approximately half
of all FAP patients will have polyps by age 14. Ninety
percent will have detectable polyps by age 25. Usually
by age 35â€“40, one or more of these polyps will become
cancerous.
FAP is a rare disease. One in 8,000 people in the
United States have FAP. However, it may be very com-
mon in affected families. FAP is inherited in an autoso-
mal dominant pattern. This means that a person with FAP
has a 50% chance of passing the condition down to each
of their children. FAP can also develop in someone with
no family history of the disorder, due to a new genetic
mutation in that individual. It is thought that approxi-
mately one percent of all colorectal cancers in the United
States can be attributed to FAP.

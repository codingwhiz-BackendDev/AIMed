Cataract surgery is not performed on both eyes at
once. To avoid risking blindness in both eyes in the
event of infection or other catastrophe, the first eye is
allowed to heal before the cataract is removed from the
second eye.
The presence of cataracts can mask additional eye
problems, such as retinal damage, that neither doctors
nor patients are aware of prior to surgery. Since such
conditions will continue to impair sight after cataract
removal if they are not identified and treated, the eventu-
al outcome of cataract surgery will depend on the out-
come of other problems.
In 1997 and 1998, evidence that cataract surgery can
contribute to the progression of age-related macular
degeneration (ARMD) was published. ARMD is the
degeneration of the central part of the retina. According-
ly, ARMD patients with cataracts must weigh the risks of
the loss of central vision, within four or five years,
against short-term improvement. When an ARMD
patient chooses cataract surgery, the surgeon should
shield the retina against bright light to protect it from
possible light-induced damage during surgery and install
an intraocular lens capable of absorbing ultraviolet and
blue light, which seem to do the most damage.

Manual testing of joint mobility by a healthcare pro-
fessional skilled in joint mobilization techniques (e.g. a
physical therapist) will identify indications of restricted
structures within the joint. Measuring the motion of the
joint with a device termed a “goniometer” can be useful
if the decrease of motion can be shown to be a proven
result of a joint contracture. X rays can be of some bene-
fit in the diagnosis of contractures, because a visible
decrease in joint space may indicate a tight, contracted
joint. Most physicians will make the diagnosis after a
thorough physical examination involving physical and
manual testing of the joint motion.

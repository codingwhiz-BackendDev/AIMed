Since CAA is associated with progressive blood ves-
sel degeneration, and since there is no effective treat-
ment, most patients have a poor prognosis. Aggressive
neurosurgical management allows increased survival fol-
lowing lobar hemorrhage, but as of 1998, 20â€“90% of
patients die from the first hemorrhage or its complica-
tions, which include progression of hemorrhage, brain
edema (swelling) with herniation (downward pressure
on vital brain structures), seizures, and infections such as
pneumonia. Many survivors have persistent neurologic
deficits related to the brain lobe affected by hemorrhage,
and are at risk for additional hemorrhages, seizures, and
dementia. Prognosis is worse in patients who are older,
or who have larger hemorrhages or recurrent hemor-
rhages within a short time.

A physical examination by a health care profes-
sional may reveal mid-abdominal pain. A rectal exami-
nation may be done to rule out bleeding. If blood is
found on rectal exam, laboratory studies, including a
blood count may be ordered. Endoscopy and barium
studies may be used to rule out underlying gastrointesti-
nal disease. Upper gastrointestinal x-ray studies using
barium may allow for visualization of abnormalities.
Endoscopy permits collection of tissue and culture speci-
mens which may be used to further confirm a diagnosis.

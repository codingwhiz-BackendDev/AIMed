incision over the blocked artery and inserting a tube
above and below the blockage to redirect the blood flow
while the artery is opened.
Next, the surgeon removes the fat and cholesterol
buildup, along with any blood clots that have formed,
with a blunt dissecting instrument. Then the surgeon
bathes the clean wall in salt solution combined with
heparin, an anticoagulant. Then the surgeon stitches the
artery just enough so that the bypass shunt tube can be
removed, and then he/she stitches the artery completely
closed. After checking to make sure no blood is leaking,
the surgeon next closes the skin incision with stitches.
The operation should improve symptoms, although
its long-term effects may be more limited, since arterial
narrowing is rarely confined to one area of one artery. If
narrowing is a problem throughout the body, arterial
reconstructive surgery may be required.
The total cost of an endarterectomy, including diag-
nostic tests, surgery, hospitalization, and follow-up care,
will vary according to hospital, doctor, and area of the
country where the operation is performed, but a patient
can expect to pay in the range of $15,000. Patients who
are very young, very old, or very ill, or who need more
extensive surgery, may require more expensive treatment.

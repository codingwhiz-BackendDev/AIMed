When removed, the diaphragm should be washed
with a mild soap and water. After being dried, it can be
dusted with corn starch before being returned to its con-
tainer. The diaphragm should always be stored away
from sunlight and heat in a cool, dry place. It should not
be washed with harsh or perfumed soaps or used with
perfumed powders because either of these substances can
damage the diaphragm.

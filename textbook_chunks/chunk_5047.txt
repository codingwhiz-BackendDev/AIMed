weight, and blood pressure, and order an annual x ray of
the wrist (to assess bone age), as well as assess blood hor-
mone levels. CAH patients with the milder form of the
disorder are usually effectively treated with hydrocorti-
sone or prednisone, if they need medical treatment at all.
Females with CAH who have masculine external
genitalia require surgery to reconstruct the clitoris and/or
vagina. This is usually performed between the ages of
one and three.
An experimental type of drug therapy—a three-drug
combination, with an androgen blocking agent (flu-
tamide), an aromatase inhibitor (testolactone), and low
dose hydrocortisone—is currently being studied by
physicians at the National Institutes of Health. Prelimi-
nary results are encouraging, but it will be many years
before the safety and effectiveness of this therapy is
fully known.
Adrenalectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the
adrenal glands, is a more radical treatment for CAH. It
was widely used before the advent of steroids. Today, it is
recommended for CAH patients with little or no enzyme
activity and can be accomplished by laparoscopy. This is
a minimally invasive type of surgery done through one or
more small 1 in (2.5 cm) incisions and a laparoscope, an
instrument with a fiber-optic light containing a tube with

What the baby eats can make a difference in stool fre-
quency and acidity. Typically, breast-fed babies will have
fewer problems with rashes. When adding a new food to
the diet, the baby should be observed closely to see
whether rashes are produced around the babyâ€™s mouth or
anus. If this occurs, the new food should be discontinued.
Babies who are taking antibiotics are more likely to
get rashes due to yeast. To help bring the good bacterial
counts back to normal, Lactobacillus bifidus can be
added to the diet. It is available in powder form from
most health food stores.

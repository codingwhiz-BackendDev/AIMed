Normally, kidneys cleanse the blood and keep its
salt, water, and acidity in balance, leaving what the body
needs in the blood and putting what the body doesn’t
need into the urine, which leaves the body. This task is
performed in two steps. First, the blood is filtered
through a kidney structure with small holes that keep the
cells and large molecules in the blood. Second, some of
the small molecules in the filtrate, needed by the body,
are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream.
This reabsorption step is defective in Fanconi’s syn-
drome. As a consequence, substances that are normally
reabsorbed, like glucose, amino acids, small proteins,
water, calcium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, and
phosphate, are lost and the body becomes overly acidic.
Fanconi’s syndrome is also known as Fanconi syn-
drome, renal Fanconi syndrome, Fanconi renaltubular
syndrome, and Lignac-de Toni-Debré-Fanconi syndrome.
Fanconi’s anemia is, however, a totally different disease.

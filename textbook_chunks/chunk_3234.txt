As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be
required to sign a consent form after the procedure is
explained thoroughly. Food and fluids will be prohibited
after midnight before the procedure. Enemas may be
ordered to clean out the bowel. If nausea or vomiting are
present, a suction tube to empty the stomach may be
used, and for laparoscopic procedures, a urinary drainage
catheter will also be used to decrease the risk of acciden-
tal puncture of the stomach or bladder with insertion of
the trocar (a sharp-pointed instrument).

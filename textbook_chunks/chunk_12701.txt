Moshe Feldenkrais (1904â€“1984) was a Russian-
born Israeli physicist and engineer who was also an
active soccer player and judo master. He devised his
system in response to his own recurring knee injury,
which had restricted his movement and caused him
great pain over a long period of time. Feldenkrais
believed that repeated muscle patterns cause the parts
of the brain controlling those muscles to stay in a fixed
pattern as well. He thought that the more the muscles
are used, the more parts of the brain can be activated.

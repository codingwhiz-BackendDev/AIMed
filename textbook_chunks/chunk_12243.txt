Most babies are weighed at birth and that weight is
used as a base line for future well-baby check-ups. If the
baby is not gaining weight at a predictable rate, the doc-
tor will do a more extensive examination. If there are no
apparent physical deformities in the digestive tract, the
doctor will examine the childâ€™s environment. As part of
that examination, the doctor will look at the family histo-
ry of height and weight. In addition, the parents will be
asked about feedings, illnesses, and family routines. If
the mother is breastfeeding the doctor will also evaluate
her diet, general health, and well being as it affects the
quantity and quality of her milk.

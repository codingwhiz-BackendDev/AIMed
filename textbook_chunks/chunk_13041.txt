Performed usually in outpatient settings, breast
fibroadenomas are removed by lumpectomy, or surgi-
cal excision under local or general anesthesia. Some-
times lumps in younger women are not removed but are
monitored by self-examination, yearly doctor check-
ups, and mammograms. Surgery is generally recom-
mended for women over 30, and for lumps that are
painful or enlarging.

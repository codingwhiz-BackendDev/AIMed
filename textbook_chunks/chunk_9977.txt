Being off medication for one to two days may trigger
seizures. Certain procedures used during EEG may trig-
ger seizures in patients with epilepsy. Those procedures
include flashing lights and deep breathing. If the EEG is
being used as a diagnostic for epilepsy (i.e., to determine
the type of seizures an individual is suffering from), this
may be a desired effect, although the patient needs to be
monitored closely so that the seizure can be aborted if
necessary. This type of test is known as an ictal EEG.

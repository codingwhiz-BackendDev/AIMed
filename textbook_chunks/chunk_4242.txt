Definition
Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhal-
ing the microscopic spores of the fungus Coccidioides
immitis. Spores are the tiny, thick-walled structures that
fungi use to reproduce. Coccidioidomycosis exists in
three forms. The acute form produces flu-like symptoms.
The chronic form can develop as many as 20 years after
initial infection and, in the lungs, can produce inflamed,
injured areas that can fill with pus (abscesses). Dissemi-
nated coccidioidomycosis describes the type of coccid-
ioidomycosis that spreads throughout the body affecting
many organ systems and is often fatal.

The most common cause of cervicitis is infection,
either local or as a result of various sexually transmitted
diseases, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. Cervicitis
can also be caused by birth control devices such as a cer-
vical cap or diaphragm, or chemical exposure. Other risk
factors include multiple sexual partners or cervical trau-
ma following birth. In postmenopausal women, cervicitis
is sometimes related to a lack of estrogen.
Although a woman may not notice any signs of
infection, symptoms of cervicitis include the following:
• persistent unusual vaginal discharge
• abnormal bleeding, either between periods or following
sexual intercourse
• painful sexual intercourse
• vaginal pain
• frequent need to urinate
• burning or itching in the vaginal area

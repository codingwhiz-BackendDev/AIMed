After the procedure, the patient is kept under obser-
vation until the effects of the medications wear off. The
patient will have to be driven home by somebody and can
generally resume a normal diet and usual activities
unless otherwise instructed. The patient will be advised
to drink lots of fluids to replace those lost by laxatives
and fasting.
For a few hours after the procedure, the patient may
feel groggy. There may be some abdominal cramping
and considerable amount of gas may be passed. If a biop-
sy was performed or a polyp was removed, there may be
small amounts of blood in the stool for a few days. If the
patient experiences severe abdominal pain or has persis-
tent and heavy bleeding, it should be brought to the doc-
torâ€™s attention immediately.

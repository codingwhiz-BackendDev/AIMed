The outside layer of skin normally forms a protec-
tive barrier that prevents infection. One of the primary
causes of dermatitis in the diaper area is prolonged skin
contact with wetness. Under these circumstances, natural
oils are stripped away, the outer layer of skin is damaged,
and there is increased susceptibility to infection by bacte-
ria or yeast.
Diaper rash is a term that covers a broad variety of
skin conditions that occur on the same area of the body.
Some babies are more prone to diaper rash than others.

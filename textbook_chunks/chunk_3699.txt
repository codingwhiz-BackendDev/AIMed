The course of CFS varies widely for different peo-
ple. Some people get progressively worse over time,
while others gradually improve. Some individuals have
periods of illness that alternate with periods of good
health. While many people with CFS never fully regain
their health, they find relief from symptoms and adapt to
the demands of the disorder by carefully following a
treatment plan combining adequate rest, nutrition, exer-
cise, and other therapies.

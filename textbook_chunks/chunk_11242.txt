The rash of erysipelas is very characteristic, raising
the practitioner’s suspicion towards that diagnosis, espe-
cially when coupled with a history of recent strep infec-
tion. Attempts to culture (grow) the bacteria from a sam-
ple of the rash usually fail. When the bacteria are present
in the blood, they may be grown in a laboratory, and
identified under a microscope. Other laboratory tests
involve reacting fluorescently-tagged antibodies with a
sample of the patient’s infected tissue. This type of test
may be successful in positively identifying the strepto-
coccal bacteria.

Connective tissue—Tissue that supports and binds
other body tissue and parts.
Lyme disease —An acute recurrent inflammatory
disease involving one or a few joints, believed to
be transmitted by a tickborne virus. The condition
was originally described in the community of
Lyme, Connecticut, but has also been reported in
other parts of the United States and other coun-
tries. Knees, other large joints are most commonly
involved with local inflammation and swelling.
Rheumatology—The study of disorders character-
ized by inflammation, degeneration of connective
tissue, and related structures of the body. These
disorders are sometimes collectively referred to as
rheumatism.
cific attention to mental health, including psychological
consultation, may also be important, since depression
may precede or accompany fibromyalgia. Other alterna-
tive therapies, including hellerwork, rolfing, homeo-
pathic medicine, Chinese traditional medicine (both
acupuncture and herbs), polarity therapy, and Western
botanical medicine, can assist the person with fibromyal-
gia to function day to day and can contribute to healing.

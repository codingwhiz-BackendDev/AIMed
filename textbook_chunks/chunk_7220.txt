A warm compress applied to the area can help
relieve pain and promote drainage. Topical and oral
antibiotics may be prescribed if an infection is present.
Intravenous antibiotics may be needed if the infection is
severe. In some cases, a tiny tube (cannula) is inserted
into the tear duct which is then flushed with a sterile salt
water solution (sterile saline). If other treatments fail to
clear up the symptoms, surgery (dacryocystorhinostomy)
to drain the lacrimal sac into the nasal cavity can be per-
formed. In extreme cases, the lacrimal sac will be
removed completely.
In infants, gentle massage of the lacrimal sac four
times daily for up to nine months can drain the sac and
sometimes clear a blockage. As the infant grows, the duct
may open by itself. If the duct does not open, it may need
to be dilated with a minor surgical procedure.

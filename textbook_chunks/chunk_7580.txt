Prevention of delirium is focused on treating or
avoiding its underlying causes. The most preventable
forms are those induced by drugs. Strategies for reducing
delirium include following prescriptions, consulting the
prescribing physician immediately if symptoms occur,
and consulting the physician before discontinuing the
drug, even if it has been ineffective; avoiding intoxica-
tion with legal or illegal drugs, and seeking professional
assistance before suddenly discontinuing an addictive
drug such as alcohol or heroin; maintaining good nutri-
tion, which promotes general health and can minimize
the likelihood of delirium from alcohol intoxication and
withdrawal; and avoiding exposure to solvents, insecti-
cides, heavy metals, or biological poisons in the home or
workplace.

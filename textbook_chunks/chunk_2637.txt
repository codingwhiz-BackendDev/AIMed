Chemotherapy drugs are classified based on how
they work. The main types of chemotherapy drugs are
described below:
• Alkylating drugs kill cancer cells by directly attacking
DNA, the genetic material of the genes. Cyclophos-
phamide is an alkylating drug.
• Antimetabolites interfere with the production of DNA
and keep cells from growing and multiplying. An
example of an antimetabolite is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
• Antitumor antibiotics are made from natural sub-
stances such as fungi in the soil. They interfere with
important cell functions, including production of DNA
and cell proteins. Doxorubicin and bleomycin belong to
this group of chemotherapy drugs.
• Plant alkaloids prevent cells from dividing normally.
Vinblastine and vincristine are plant alkaloids obtained
from the periwinkle plant.
• Steroid hormones slow the growth of some cancers that
depend on hormones. For example, tamoxifen is used
to treat breast cancers that depend on the hormone
estrogen for growth.

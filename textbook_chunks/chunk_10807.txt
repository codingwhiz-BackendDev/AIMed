Whether or not BPH is caused by hormonal changes
in aging men, there is no known way of preventing it.
Once it does develop and symptoms are present that
interfere seriously with the patientâ€™s life, timely medical
or surgical treatment will reliably prevent symptoms
from getting worse. Also, if the condition is treated
before the prostate has become grossly enlarged, the risk
of complications is minimal. One of the potentially most
serious complications of BPH, urinary infection (and
possible infection of the kidneys), can be prevented by
using a catheter to drain excess urine out of the bladder
so that it does not collect, stagnate, and become infected.

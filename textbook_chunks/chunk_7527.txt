• To test for exposure to specific diseases, such as tuber-
culosis (TB). Tuberculosis testing is done by injecting
into the skin a small volume of TB antigen, which con-
tains no organisms (live or dead) but can still provoke
an immune response.
• To test for allergic sensitivity to potential skin irritants,
such as poison ivy. Skin allergy testing is usually done
by placing a series of adhesive patches on the skin con-
taining potential allergens, or allergy-causing sub-
stances.
• To assess the vitality of the T cell response as part of
the evaluation of immune system health in infection,
cancer, immune disorders, pre-transplantation screen-
ing, aging, and malnutrition. DHT can help predict
survival in immunocompromised patients, and evalu-
ate the success of restorative therapy. Antigens used
for these tests must be ones the patient has been
exposed to before, and, therefore, include inactivated
antigens from common infectious agents to which the
patient might have been exposed, such as mumps,
Candida albicans, tetanus toxoid, and trichophyton (a
skin fungus).

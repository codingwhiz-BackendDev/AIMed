Some cases of blepharitis are caused by bacterial
infection and some by head lice, but in some cases, the
cause is unclear. It may also be caused by an overproduc-
tion of oil by the meibomian glands. Blepharitis can be a
chronic condition that begins in early childhood and can
last throughout life. Symptoms can include itching, burn-
ing, a feeling that something is in the eye, inflammation,
and scales or matted, hard crusts surrounding the eyelashes.

advised to have the more complex operation. FAP
patients felt to be at lower risk for rectal polyps might be
counseled to consider the less radical surgery.
Medical therapy to treat the adenomatous polyps has
been attempted. Some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs have been effective in reducing the number and
size of the polyps. It is possible that these agents will be
used as an additional treatment for FAP, but they are
unlikely to replace surgery.
Individuals with FAP are at increased risk for cancers
of the upper digestive tract including the upper portion of
the small bowel (dudodenum) and the channels where
bile flows (biliary tract). Cancers of the thyroid, pancreas,
and adrenal gland are also more commonly found among
FAP patients. Periodic examination for the development
of malignancy in these areas is considered part of the
treatment of FAP. In some cases, such as cancer involving
the duodenum, the tests themselves carry a chance of
complications. The risk of the study must be weighed
against the potential benefits of knowing the results. Non-
malignant growths, called desmoid tumors, also occur
more frequently in patients with FAP. Although they are
not malignant, they grow quickly into surrounding tis-
sues, causing many difficulties, even death in some cases.

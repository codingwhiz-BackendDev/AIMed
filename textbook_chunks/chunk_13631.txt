Folliculitis can affect both women and men at any
age. It can develop on any part of the body, but is most
likely to occur on the scalp, face, or parts of the arms,
armpits, or legs not usually covered by clothing.
Small, yellowish-white blister-like lumps (pustules)
surrounded by narrow red rings are usually present with
both bacterial folliculitis and fungal folliculitis. Hair can
grow through or alongside of the pustules, which some-
times ooze blood-stained pus.
Folliculitis can cause boils and, in rare instances,
serious skin infections. Bacteria from folliculitis can enter
the blood stream and travel to other parts of the body.

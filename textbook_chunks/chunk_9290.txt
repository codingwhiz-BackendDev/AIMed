If a child is diagnosed with dyslexia, the parents
should find out from the school or the diagnostician
exactly what the problem is, and what method of teach-
ing is recommended and why. No single method will
work with every child, and experts often disagree as to
the best method to use.
The primary focus of treatment is aimed at helping
the specific learning problem of each affected person.
Most often, this may include modifying teaching meth-
ods and the educational environment, since traditional
educational methods will not always work with a dyslex-
ic child.
People with dyslexia need a structured language pro-
gram, with direct instruction in the letter-sound system.
Teachers must give the rules governing written language.
Most experts agree that the teacher should emphasize the
association between simple phonetic units with letters or
letter groups, rather than an approach that stresses mem-
orizing whole words.
It is important to teach these students using all the
senses: hearing, touching, writing, and speaking, provid-
ed by an instructor who is specifically trained in a pro-
gram that is effective for dyslexic students.

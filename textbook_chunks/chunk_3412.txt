A wide variety of prescription medicines are avail-
able to treat cholesterol problems. These include statins
such as Mevacor (lovastatin), Lescol (fluvastatin), Prava-
chol (pravastatin), Zocor (simvastatin), Baycol (cervas-
tatin), and Lipitor (atorvastatin) to lower LDL. A group
of drugs called fibric acid derivatives are used to lower
triglycerides and raise HDL. These include Lopid (gem-
fibrozil), Atromid-S (clofibrate), and Tricor (fenofibrate).
Doctors decide which drug to use based on the severity
of the cholesterol problem, side effects, and cost.

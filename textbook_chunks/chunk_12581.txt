Also called steatosis, fatty liver can be a temporary or
long-term condition, which is not harmful itself, but may
indicate some other type of problem. Left untreated, it can
contribute to other illnesses. It is usually reversible once
the cause of the problem is diagnosed and corrected. The
liver is the organ responsible for changing fats eaten in
the diet to types of fat that can be stored and used by the
body. Triglycerides are one of the forms of fat stored by
the body and used for energy and new cell formation. The
break down of fats in the liver can be disrupted by alco-
holism, malnutrition, pregnancy, or poisoning. In fatty
liver, large droplets of fat, containing mostly triglycerides,
collect within cells of the liver. The condition is generally
not painful and may go unnoticed for a long period of
time. In severe cases, the liver can increase to over three
times its normal size and may be painful and tender.

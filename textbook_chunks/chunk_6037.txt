Increased levels of cortisol are found in Cushing’s
syndrome, excess thyroid (hyperthyroidism), obesity,
ACTH-producing tumors, and high levels of stress.
Decreased levels of cortisol are found in Addison’s
disease, conditions of low thyroid, and hypopituitarism,
in which pituitary activity is diminished.

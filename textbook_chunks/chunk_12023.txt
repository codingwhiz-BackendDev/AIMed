irregularities in the cornea.
Cornea—The clear outer covering of the front of the
eye.
Index of refraction—A constant number for any
material for any given color of light that is an indi-
cator of the degree of the bending of the light
caused by that material.
Lens—A device that bends light waves.
Permeable—Capable of allowing substances to pass
through.
Polycarbonate—A very strong type of plastic often
used in safety glasses, sport glasses, and children’s
eyeglasses. Polycarbonate lenses have approximate-

Polymer—A substance formed by joining smaller
molecules. For example, plastic, acrylic, cellulose

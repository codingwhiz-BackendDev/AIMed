Information from the medical history and physical
examination usually needs to be supplemented by tests
that provide objective measurements of anal and rectal
function. Anorectal manometry, a common procedure,
involves inserting a small tube (catheter) or balloon
device into the anal canal or rectum. Manometry mea-
sures, among other things, pressure levels in the anal
canal, rectal sensation, and anal and rectal reflexes. Tests
are also available for assessing nerve damage. An anal
ultrasound probe can supply accurate images of the anal
sphincter and reveal whether injury has occurred. Mag-
netic resonance imaging, which requires the insertion of
a coil into the anal canal, is useful at times.

Although there is no effective treatment for the under-
lying disease process of CAA, measures can be taken to
prevent brain hemorrhage in patients diagnosed with CAA.
High blood pressure should be treated aggressively, and
even normal blood pressure can be lowered as much as tol-
erated without side effects from medications. Blood thin-
ners such as Coumadin, antiplatelet agents such as aspirin,
or medications designed to dissolve blood clots may cause
hemorrhage in patients with CAA, and should be avoided if
possible. If these medications are required for other condi-
tions, such as heart disease, the potential benefits must be
carefully weighed against the increased risks.
Seizures, or recurrent neurologic symptoms thought
to be seizures, should be treated with anti-epileptic
drugs, although Depakote (sodium valproate) should be
avoided because of its antiplatelet effect. Anti-epileptic
drugs are sometimes given to patients with large lobar
hemorrhage in an attempt to prevent seizures, although
the benefit of this is unclear.
Once brain hemorrhage has occurred, the patient
should be admitted to a hospital (ICU) for neurologic
monitoring and control of increased pressure within the
brain, blood pressure control, and supportive medical

None

• no pupil reaction to light
• no response of the eyes to caloric (warm or cold) stimu-
lation
• no jaw reflex (the jaw will react like the knee if hit with
a reflex hammer)
• no gag reflex (touching the back of the throat induces
vomiting)
• no response to pain
• no breathing
• a body temperature above 86°F (30°C), which elimi-
nates the possibility of resuscitation following cold-
water drowning
• no other cause for the above, such as a head injury
• no drugs present in the body that could cause apparent
death
• all of the above for 12 hours
• all of the above for six hours and a flat-line electroen-
cephalogram (brain wave study)
• no blood circulating to the brain, as demonstrated by
angiography
Current ability to resuscitate people who have
“died” has produced some remarkable stories. Drowning
in cold water (under 50°F/10°C) so effectively slows
metabolism that some persons have been revived after a
half hour under water.

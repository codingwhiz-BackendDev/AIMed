In most cases treatment of symptoms is all that is
possible. Present medications can reduce the duration
and severity of an acute infection, but are only 50%

endoscopic or surgical methods to improve esophageal
emptying, similar to those used to treat the disorder
known as achalasia. Constipation is treated by increas-
ing fiber and bulk laxatives, or removal of diseased por-
tions of the colon.

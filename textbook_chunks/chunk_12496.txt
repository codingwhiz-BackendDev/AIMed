Through evolution, the body became very efficient
at storing energy and handling situations when no food
was available. For many centuries, fasting was probably
a normal occurrence for most people, and the body
adapted to it. It is estimated that even very thin people
can survive for 40 days or more without food. The body
has a special mechanism that is initiated when no food is
eaten. Fasting is not starvation, but rather the bodyâ€™s
burning of stored energy. Starvation occurs when the
body no longer has any stored energy and begins using
essential tissues such as organs for an energy source.
Therapeutic fasts are stopped long before this happens.
Many physiological changes occur in the body dur-
ing fasting. During the first day or so, the body uses its
glycogen reserves, the sugars that are the basic energy
supply. After these are depleted, the body begins using
fat. However, the brain, which has high fuel require-
ments, still needs glucose (sugars converted from glyco-
gen). To obtain glucose for the brain, the body begins to
break down muscle tissue during the second day of the
fast. Thus, during fasting some muscle loss will occur. To
fuel the brain, the body would need to burn over a pound
of muscle a day, but the body has developed another way
to create energy that saves important muscle mass. This
protein-sparing process is called ketosis, which occurs
during the third day of a fast for men and the second day
for women. In this highly efficient state, the liver begins
converting stored fat and other nonessential tissues into
ketones, which can be used by the brain, muscles, and

Some practitioners use spinal manipulation to the
exclusion of all other modalities, and are known as
straight chiropractors. Others integrate various types of
therapy such as massage, nutritional intervention, or
treatment with vitamins, herbs, or homeopathic reme-
dies. They also embrace ideas from other health care tra-
ditions. This group is known as mixers. The vast majority
of chiropractors, perhaps 85%, fall in this latter category.

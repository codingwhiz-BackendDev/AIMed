An infant who does not wet a diaper in an eight-
hour period is dehydrated. The soft spot on the baby’s
head (fontanel) may be depressed. Symptoms of dehy-
dration at any age include cracked lips, dry or sticky
mouth, lethargy, and sunken eyes. A person who is
dehydrated cries without shedding tears and does not
urinate very often. The skin is less elastic than it should
be and is slow to return to its normal position after
being pinched.
Dehydration can cause confusion, constipation, dis-
comfort, drowsiness, fever, and thirst. The skin turns pale
and cold, the mucous membranes lining the mouth and
nose lose their natural moisture. The pulse sometimes
races and breathing becomes rapid. Significant fluid loss
can cause serious neurological problems.

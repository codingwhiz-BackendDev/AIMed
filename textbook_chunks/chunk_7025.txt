presence of bacteria or pus in the urine usually indicates
infection. The presence of hematuria, or blood in the
urine, may indicate acute UTIs, kidney disease, kidney
stones,
inflammation of the prostate (in men),
endometriosis (in women), or cancer of the urinary
tract. In some cases, blood in the urine results from ath-
letic training, particularly in runners.

Fever evaluation tests, better known as febrile
agglutinins tests, are performed to detect the presence of
antibodies in the blood that are sensitive to temperature
changes. Antibodies are proteins produced by the
immune system in response to specific infectious agents,
such as viruses or bateria. Febrile agglutinins are anti-
bodies that cause red blood cells to clump, but only when
the blood is warmed to temperatures higher than the
average body temperature of 98.6°F (37°C).

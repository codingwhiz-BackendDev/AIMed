Improper warm up can lead to muscle strains.
Overexertion with not enough time between exercise ses-
sions to recuperate can also lead to muscle strains, result-
ing in inactivity due to pain. Stress fractures are also a
possibility if activities are strenuous over long periods of
time without proper rest. Although exercise is safe for the
majority of children and adults, there is still a need for
further studies to identify potential risks.

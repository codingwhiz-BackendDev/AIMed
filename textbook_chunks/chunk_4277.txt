The coccyx consists of fused vertebrae, which are
not flexible like the other vertebrae of the vertebral col-
umn which are all interspaced by intervertebral disks and
joined together by elastic ligaments. Since the spinal
cord ends just before the coccyx begins, coccygeal verte-
brae also lack a central foramen (hole). In the coccyx, the
vertebrae generally fuse together in early adulthood and
may also fuse with the sacrum, the bone located between
the 5th lumbar vertebra and the coccyx, as a person ages.
In males, the coccyx curves downward, and in females, it
is straighter to allow a baby to pass through the birth
canal without impediment.
Pain in or around the coccyx is called coccydynia or
coccygodynia. Coccydynia presents a range of symptoms
associated to a variety of underlying causes and conditions.

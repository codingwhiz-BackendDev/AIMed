triggered by an electrical impulse. These electrical
impulses travel through specialized cells that form a con-
duction system. Following this pathway ensures that con-
tractions will occur in a coordinated manner.
When the presence of all waves is observed in the
electrocardiogram and these waves follow the order
defined alphabetically, the heart is said to show a normal
sinus rhythm, and impulses may be assumed to be fol-
lowing the regular conduction pathway.
The heart is described as showing arrhythmia or dys-
rhythmia when time intervals between waves, the order,
or the number of waves do not fit this pattern. Other fea-
tures that may be altered include the direction of wave
deflection and wave widths.
In the normal heart, electrical impulses—at a rate of
60–100 times per minute—originate in the sinus node.
The sinus node is located in the first chamber, known as
the right atrium, where blood re-enters the heart. After
traveling down to the junction between the upper and
lower chambers, the signal stimulates the atrioventricular
node. From here, after a delay, it passes by specialized
routes through the lower chambers or ventricles. In many
disease states, the passage of the electrical impulse can
be interrupted in a variety of ways, causing the heart to
perform less efficiently.
